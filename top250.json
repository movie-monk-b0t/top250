      "reviewBody": "This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.\n\nOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red\u0027s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". \n\nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. \n\nWhatever you do, don\u0027t listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",

      "name": "An Iconic Film",
      "reviewBody": "Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can\u0027t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.\n\nThe acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.\n\nThe directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.\n\nThe cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.\n\nThe horse\u0027s head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I\u0027ll give him an offer he can\u0027t refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don\u0027t know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90\u0027s TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating\u0027s sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?\n\nThere could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer\u0027s attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY\u0027S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant\u0027s guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very \"ordinariness\" is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they\u0027re all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!\n\n12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how \"truth\" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda\u0027s role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?\n\nThis is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide. IF you haven\u0027t seen it - you really should do something about that!",

      "reviewBody": "Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.\n\nWhich of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien\u0027s books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.\n\nThe heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.\n\nThe casting and acting are superb.\n\nThe film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy\u0027s well-earned crown.\n\nReturn of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you\u0027ll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien\u0027s grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien\u0027s examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.\n\nEven more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien\u0027s world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien\u0027s book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien\u0027s epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",

Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5.",

      "reviewBody": "I wasn\u0027t sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts, but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.\n\nThis film, in my opinion, is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.\n\nThe music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven\u0027t seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song \"Ecstacy of Gold\" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.\n\nThe story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone\u0027s direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.\n\nLee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as \"Angel Eyes.\" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as \"Blondie,\" although I don\u0027t think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that\u0027s OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).\n\nThis movie is hypnotic. It\u0027s operatic. It\u0027s sad. It\u0027s funny. It\u0027s gritty. It\u0027s violent. It\u0027s art. It\u0027s action. It\u0027s pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it\u0027s so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven\u0027t seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the trailers for \"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy. But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie. I thought it was a fabulous work of art.\n\nI thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story. It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider\u0027s advantage on the rest of the audience. Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen. Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.\n\nThe entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. The Shire was almost exactly as I\u0027d pictured it. Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real. Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same. The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it\u0027s amazing that \"Fellowship\" was filmed in one country.\n\nNow to the characters. All I can say is, \"Wow.\" I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I\u0027d created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn\u0027t want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least. Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood\u0027s pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits. He also cries like a little girl. But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character. The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too. Sean Astin (\"Rudy\" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien\u0027s telling. Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding. He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting. Some may have complained about Arwen\u0027s character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change. In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in \"The Return of the King\" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are. Speaking of Elves, I can\u0027t help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas. Bloom captured the archer\u0027s very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas\u0027s bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style. He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film. Gimli was pompous and brave, as well. He is well-represented in the movie. Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong. Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior. Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond. He was noble and cold at the same time. And Gandalf. What more can be said of Ian McKellan\u0027s showcase portrayal of the wizard? He was magnificent. He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children. Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.\n\nPeter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places. Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron\u0027s mouth water. Knowing that \"The Two Towers\" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",

      "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump (1994) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nForrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend.\n\nFORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I\u0027ve never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don\u0027t understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there\u0027s FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.\n\nAs far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I\u0027ve always liked how the film took a look at a simple person\u0027s life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they\u0027ve entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it\u0027s always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.\n\nI thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I\u0027ve always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there\u0027s no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.\n\nThen there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY\u0027S FOOL, there\u0027s no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that \"simple\" man and there\u0027s not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank\u0027s character and Sally Field is good as well.\n\nNo matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.",

      "name": "Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards",
      "reviewBody": "The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several \"levels\" at once, I still found it easy to follow.\n\nThe film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I\u0027m smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don\u0027t lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too \"ordinary\" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don\u0027t make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.\n\nTo its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb\u0027s subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable \"baddie\" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that \"was the real level actually a dream\" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going \"or was it?\" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).\n\nThe cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to \"come in\" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of \"oh look its x\" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn\u0027t really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.\n\nI\u0027m not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn\u0027t – pay attention. Doesn\u0027t quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",

      "reviewBody": "`It avoids having the standard shoot-\u0027em-up ending,\u0027 says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.\u0027 I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I\u0027m therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can\u0027t discuss this without giving things away to those few who don\u0027t know what happens. If you\u0027re one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.\n\nAfter the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han\u0027s party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.\n\nThe training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn\u0027t matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han\u0027s being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it\u0027s the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi\u0027, which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That\u0027s enough.\n\nAs for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke\u0027s human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.\n\nWhen George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You\u0027ll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn\u0027t room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It\u0027s also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",

      "reviewBody": "Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain\u0027t gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.\n\nI\u0027ll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn\u0027t happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it\u0027s like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "name": "Kurosawa\u0027s triumphant epic- totally \u0026 successfully driven by character and story",
      "reviewBody": "Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I\u0027ve had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I\u0027d have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug\u0027s Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There\u0027s no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn\u0027t exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan\u0027s most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he\u0027s a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. \n\nKurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn\u0027t his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn\u0027t over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn\u0027t distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa\u0027s editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn\u0027t a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film. The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt\u0027s supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.\n\nThe movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting. There is a \"Pseudo-Noir\" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it\u0027s philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.\n\nAndrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes. As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy. In this respect, the film doesn\u0027t \"preach\" any special meaning even though the film\u0027s moral statements are still maintained. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.\n\nOutstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****",

Actually, it\u0027s probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.\n\nThe characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is \"Lil\u0027 Dice\u0027s\" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.\n\nThe City of God is a world you don\u0027t want to visit, it won\u0027t be featured on a post card, and it\u0027s said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it\u0027s violent temptation. More importantly, it\u0027s about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.\n\nThis movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it\u0027s worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.\n\nYou see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.",

I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It\u0027s actually funny.\n\nBenigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I\u0027ve ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn\u0027t scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He\u0027s got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you\u0027re witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.\n\nI loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.",

This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.\n\nWithout unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman\u0027s private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.\n\nAs a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10",

There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of \"It\u0027s A Wonderful Life\" still hold true today. Yes, I\u0027ll say it, it\u0027s a wonderful movie.",

      "reviewBody": "\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\"\n\nPre review:\n\nIt\u0027s writing started in January 1973, \"eight hours a day, five days a week\", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThen, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was \"too strange\".\n\nSuddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that deeply trusted in Lucas genius. And that\u0027s how Star Wars became a reality.\n\nThe filming of the movie was difficult, full of mishaps, problems with practical effects, a bad first edit of the movie, but that did not stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, the Fox Study began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...\n\nReview:\n\nStar Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure and excitement. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...\n\nOne of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick\u0027s revolutionary masterpiece: \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.\n\nThe story and the characters are original and compelling. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer\u0027s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel \"in distress\", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.\n\nThe visual composition is authentic and gives the movie a powerful aesthetic value, such as the \u0027Binary Sunset\u0027 scene, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke\u0027s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he can see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for the dreamer he really is.\n\nThe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.\n\nFor sound design, Lucas wanted real noises, not synthesized science-fiction twitters. Thus Star Wars\u0027s spacecraft doors open and sandcrawlers rumble with whooshes and clatter from the Philadelphia subway, recorded by soundman Ben Burtt.\n\n Star Wars is far more experimental than believe. Lucas\u0027s new methods baffled Fox executives, as he used two and sometimes three or four cameras: encouraging improvisation, he reserved his options for postproduction. He called for naturalistic acting to anchor the space fantasy. He started in close, avoiding establishing shots. He wanted a nostalgic \"filtered look\" but kept changing key lights for a \"flashing, strobing\" effect. He used a loose, \"nervous\" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.\n\nBooks such as \"The hero with a thousand faces\" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa\u0027s storytelling influenced the focused on minor characters... The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.\n\n10/10",

I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank\u0027s character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank\u0027s performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",

      "reviewBody": "Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn\u0027t get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children\u0027s mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator\u0027s thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.\n\ne.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don\u0027t mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.\n\nApart from that, did you ever notice that some \"camera language\" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the \"camera\" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji\u0027s introduction about Haku\u0027s background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.\n\nThere\u0027re many other things like this, shouldn\u0027t be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that\u0027s not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.\n\nI am a visual effects person and film maker but I can\u0027t tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character\u0027s movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don\u0027t have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio\u0027s work. \"Spirited Away\" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.\n\n\"Ice Age\" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with \"Spirited Away\" I\u0027m afraid. And I\u0027d laugh at the opinion that the story of \"Ice Age\" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn\u0027t recognise it, actually I believe \"Spirited Away\" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while \"Ice Age\" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I\u0027m afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one.",

      "reviewBody": "THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****\n\nStarring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)\n\n By Blake French:\n\n\tIt\u0027s not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. \"The Green Mile\" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. \n\nThe story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.\n\nHe tells of a particular year in the 1930\u0027s. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn\u0027t like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. \n\n\tThroughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.\n\n I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey\u0027s magical powers; the miracles aren\u0027t investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey\u0027s abilities are a gift from God from the character\u0027s dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.\n\n\"The Green Mile\" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from \"American Beauty\" in the best performance of 1999. \n\n The message to \"The Green Mile\" is clear and understandable: justice isn\u0027t always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. \n\nBrought to you by Warner Bros.",

I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn\u0027t get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.",

I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited \u0027The Usual Suspects\u0027 is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of \"Ran\", \"Kagemusha\" and \"Sword of Doom\") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think \"Wild Bunch with katanas\", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).\n\nKobayashi\u0027s direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai\u0027s performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.\n\nIf you\u0027re open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you\u0027ve ever seen.",

Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he\u0027s groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****",

      "reviewBody": "Strong performances by Edward Norton \u0026 Edward Furlong really make this film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black \u0026 white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic, ironically by a British director. The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature \u0026 brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. AHX tracks Derek\u0027s history through the first formation of racist sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo Nazi propaganda. The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends. Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the Anti-Jewish sepal he\u0027s been living with so long. The problem lies with his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being influenced like he was. Derek\u0027s cross to bear is that he can\u0027t change his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right side of humanity. I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants the same for his brother. Kaye\u0027s use of black \u0026 white creates an atmospheric drama that builds tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by the same man (Derek / Norton). Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on every high school curriculum",

This generation\u0027s \"It\u0027s a Wonderful Life\"? Think about it. Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv\u0027s \"Family Ties\", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney). There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish. High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis. Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean. Oscar-nominated song \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film. Classic.",

Seeing the \u0027feeding machine\u0027 again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter. To eat is to live, it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as \u0027they\u0027 regulate our speech, our food, our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of \u0027nice\u0027.

      "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that\u0027s been talked about to death? Just this: If you\u0027ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it\u0027s a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it\u0027s so fun to watch.\n\nJanet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss\u0027s obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk\u0027s possessive mother, who as her boy explains, \"is not herself today.\" I\u0027ll say she isn\u0027t, and so would Leigh\u0027s Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign before taking a shower.\n\nYou can feel the decade literally shifting out of \u002750s and into \u002760s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what\u0027s going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.\n\nMost especially, there\u0027s Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion\u0027s boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word \"falsity\" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.\n\nHe shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam\u0027s boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you\u0027re always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he\u0027s busy covering up \"Mother\u0027s\" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.\n\nIf you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote\u0027s. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for \"Psycho.\" Certainly \"Psycho\" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.\n\nIt\u0027s thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.\n\nIs it the best Hitchcock movie? It\u0027s definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.\n\nOften imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, \"Psycho\" still isn\u0027t played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",

      "reviewBody": "Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator\u0027s opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar\u0027s soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.\u0027\n\nThe plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator\u0027s every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.\n\nScott\u0027s cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.\n\n It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator\u0027s best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil\u0027, but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.\n\nAs a vehicle for the plot, Scott\u0027s beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film\u0027s spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott\u0027s first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.\n\nThe battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.\n\nAlways one to embrace technology, Scott\u0027s views over Rome\u0027s landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!\n\nAll those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron\u0027s titanic sails.",

      "reviewBody": "Charlie Chaplin\u0027s \"City Lights\" contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it. Although made very much in the old-fashioned silent film tradition, much of it is timeless, too.\n\nAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning, Charlie\u0027s \"little tramp\" character makes two acquaintances. He meets a blind girl selling flowers, who mistakes him for a rich man, and the two become very fond of each other. Then he meets a real millionaire, who is drunk, depressed, and about to commit suicide. In a comic scene, the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it, making himself a devoted friend.\n\nThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight, and tries to think of some way he could help. His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving, while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades - his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny, and one of Chaplin\u0027s best comic pieces. Meanwhile, when his millionaire friend is drunk, he dotes on the tramp, but when sober he forgets who the tramp is, leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for Charlie.\n\nAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the best-remembered scenes in any film. \"City Lights\" shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master, who without words can move his audience or make them laugh. Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once.",

      "reviewBody": "The Departed\n\nThe screenplay: Top Notch\n\nThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performances\n\nThe music: perfect\n\nThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.\n\nOnce again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, \"Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.\" \n\nThis film is Scorsese\u0027s finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. \n\nHowever the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg\u0027s Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.\n\nSince The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.\n\nThat was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",

      "reviewBody": "When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I\u0027ve seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle\u0027s highly intense psychological drama \"Whiplash.\" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I\u0027m about to compare, I haven\u0027t felt this uneasy with a film\u0027s tension since Paul Greengrass\u0027 \"Captain Phillips,\" coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year\u0027s very best turns.\n\nChazelle\u0027s film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).\n\nWalking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my \"Oscar Isaac\" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven\u0027t seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in \"Rabbit Hole,\" and then helming \"The Spectacular Now\" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in \"Whiplash.\" There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in \"Amadeus,\" as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.\n\nEverything you\u0027ve heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn\u0027t write Fletcher as a caricature. He\u0027s a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn\u0027t keep Simmons at a \"10,\" he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning \"Inglourious Basterds,\" a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor\u0027s career that included memorable roles in \"Juno,\" \"Burn After Reading,\" and \"Up in the Air,\" a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman\u0027s \"Men, Women \u0026 Children,\" writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor\u0027s door.\n\nYou can\u0027t credit \"Whiplash\" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut \"Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench\") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I\u0027m sure we don\u0027t know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer\u0027s story. It\u0027s one of the best scripts of the year.\n\n\"Whiplash\" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight.\n\n\"Whiplash\" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!",

      "reviewBody": "I won\u0027t say it\u0027s an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan\u0027s broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it\u0027s obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn\u0027t even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don\u0027t get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That\u0027s quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That\u0027s until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn\u0027t make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn\u0027t so adorable. He didn\u0027t remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don\u0027t even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It\u0027s after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it\u0027s a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",

      "reviewBody": "Thank god that I\u0027m a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie, and dumb kid that I was, I actually watched it thinking I was in for a typical Bronson \"vehicle\"! Looking back I\u0027m thankful, because if it wasn\u0027t for his involvement, I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\nI absolutely love this movie. It\u0027s probably my all time favourite, certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.\n\nOUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his \"Dollars\" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups, practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it\u0027s all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that\u0027s not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don\u0027t think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.\n\nThe cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.\n\nWhich leaves the hero; I\u0027m a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don\u0027t believe he could have done the role justice. His \"man with no name\" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that\u0027s why he\u0027s put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he\u0027s been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn\u0027t have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).\n\nOf course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I\u0027m in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don\u0027t know, but that\u0027s the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it\u0027s unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.\n\nHigh Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. are all classics of the genre, but I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to compare those \"traditional\" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it\u0027s own, it\u0027s the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you\u0027re on the right wavelength you\u0027ll be greatly rewarded.",

I hesitated at first, but then I said \"Oh well, I\u0027ll give it a try.\" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I\u0027ve ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.\n\nThis movie isn\u0027t your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I\u0027m not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn\u0027t trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.\n\nI am kind of upset, that this movie didn\u0027t get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi\u0027s best movie they have ever released.\n\nI truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.\n\nAn Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.\n\nQuite Simply 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio\u0027s death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir\u0027s idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman\u0027s heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.\n\nBut then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.\n\nMeanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption \u0027a typical Jew\u0027 so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. \u0027Entree des artistes\u0027, a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio\u0027s scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.\n\nAfter a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in \u0027Hold Back the Dawn\u0027, a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.\n\nIn early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, \u0027Everybody Comes to Rick\u0027s\u0027 but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.\n\nShooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.\n\nThey produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to \u0027Casablanca\u0027.\n\nIt is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. \u0027We\u0027ll always have Paris\u0027, \u0027I was misinformed\u0027, \u0027Here\u0027s looking at you, kid\u0027, \u0027 I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there\u0027s gambling going on in here!\u0027, \u0027Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\u0027, \u0027Oh he\u0027s just like any other man, only more so\u0027, \u0027I don\u0027t mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one\u0027, \u0027Round up the usual suspects\u0027, and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, \u0027Play it again, Sam\u0027.\n\nMadeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.\n\nAnd when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, \u0027I\u0027m shocked! Shocked! To find that there\u0027s gambling going on in here!\u0027 the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, \u0027Your winnings, sir.\u0027 It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.\n\nI have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.\n\nAlas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.\n\nLate in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply \u0027old man in whore house\u0027, in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what \u0027grand themes\u0027 may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival.",

It\u0027s about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that\u0027s what makes it different. It\u0027s BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.

      "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience\u0027s thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors\u0027 private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he\u0027s looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly\u0027s) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn\u0027t trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It\u0027s a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock\u0027s first truly \u0027fifties\u0027 film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he\u0027d been doing before. There\u0027s less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it\u0027s romantic about couples and cynical about people. There\u0027s a little bit of everything in it,--it\u0027s a work of art.",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer \"director\u0027s cut.\"\n\nMost of the new footage involved the main\u0027s character\u0027s romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.\n\nThe first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as \"Toto\" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult \"Alfredo\" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.\n\nThe word \"love\" is used repeatedly in this review because that\u0027s the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.\n\nThe second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and \"Elena\" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.\n\nIt\u0027s very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his \"masterpiece.\"",

Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.\n\nThe story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel \"Nostromo\" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.\n\nThe music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.\n\nThis is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. \"Alien\" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10\n\nRated R: violence/gore and profanity",

      "reviewBody": "My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary \u0027Heart of Darkness\u0027 made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making \u0027the Godfather\u0027 and \u0027GodfatherII\u0027 and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like \u0027Apocalypse Now\u0027. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz\u0027s compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN\u0027T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about \u0027Apocalypse Now\u0027 is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. \n\nThis movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn\u0027t at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is \u0027Platoon\u0027 in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. \n\nCoppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.\n\nIt is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.\n\nA little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the \u0027Redux\u0027 version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a \u0027new and improved\u0027 version of the movie",

      "reviewBody": "So the \"innovative\" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here\u0027s a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.\n\nHaving read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I\u0027d go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable. I couldn\u0027t be further from the truth. This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries. Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does. Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife. Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\n\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I\u0027m still not sure. This film noir concept shouldn\u0027t work, but it does so wonderfully.",

In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie\u0027s characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.\n\nThis is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.\n\nUlrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film. Some have compared \"The Lives of Others\" to Coppola\u0027s \"The Conversation\" but the two have completely different story arcs and are only superficially similar.\n\nBoth my companion and I felt this was our favorite of the six films we had a chance to see at the festival.",

      "reviewBody": "In Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear. \n\nSchultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You\u0027re gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can\u0027t believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit—an all blue with white ruffle get-up. \n\nIt\u0027s a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It\u0027s a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It\u0027s an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way—watch out, here I come, I ain\u0027t gonna be quiet no more.\n\nAnd the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film—it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick—that\u0027s why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It\u0027s been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it\u0027s Tarantino at his most epic.",

      "reviewBody": "Paths Of Glory is a masterpiece without doubt. Usually a masterpiece is the pinnacle of a directors career. However when you are talking about Stanley Kubrick, you are talking about genuine genius. This is just one of his many masterpieces, but Paths Of Glory is probably as good a film as any of Kubrick\u0027s other best works. I have seen tons of war films in my life, many great ones. Honestly, this is my favorite of them all. When I first saw this film I didn\u0027t expect it to blow me away. After all it is an early Kubrick film, however it blew me away constantly, and completely. This is not only one of the greatest war films ever made, not only one of the greatest black \u0026 white films ever made, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made bar none. The film screams integrity, in each and every way. This film is a joy to watch, and in my estimation, Paths Of Glory will remain forever as one of cinemas greatest accomplishments.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.\n\nOkay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn\u0027t fare so bad. It\u0027s how Kubrick perceives King\u0027s universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.\n\nHorror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.\n\nKubrick\u0027s cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.\n\nCertain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack\u0027s typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel\u0027s elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it\u0027s the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid\u0027s face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.\n\nMuch has been said of Jack Nicholson\u0027s obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he\u0027s Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad.",

      "reviewBody": "In Hollywood of the 50\u0027s, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.\n\n\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched \"Sunset Boulevard\" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called \"Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back\" (a.k.a. \"The Making of Sunset Boulevard\" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Crepúsculo dos Deuses\" (\"Dusk of the Gods\")",

      "reviewBody": "The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the \"extended universe\", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven\u0027t really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen, I hear you. \"How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?\" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There\u0027s also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn\u0027t his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have? Look, I don\u0027t have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It\u0027s simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that\u0027s more than enough.",

Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn\u0027t a \"they all lived naively ever after\" film. There were no complete \"good\" or \"bad\" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki\u0027s films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka\u0027s romance and Moro\u0027s views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.\n\nLike many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.\n\nThe only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).\n\n10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "\u0027Gentlemen. You can\u0027t fight here this is the war room.\u0027\n\nStanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.\n\nGeneral Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.\n\nColonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.\n\nFinally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.\n\nIt is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.\n\nIt is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.\n\nGeorge C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.\n\nThe film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane.",

Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice.

The original short story(rather unremarkable, actually)has been expanded into a magnificent example of Hollywood entertainment at its best. In addition to perhaps the finest line-up of character actors ever assembled(next to Cukor\u0027s David Copperfield, that is), we get Laughton and Dietrich at the top of their form. The person who criticised Lanchester\u0027s performance as \"annoying\" missed the point entirely. Miss Plimsoll is meant to be annoying! Also, what\u0027s with all the bad-mouthing of Tyrone Power? \"Hammy\"; \"terrible\"; \"worst performance ever\". These are the perceptive IMDb reviews? Only one of you got it right: it\u0027s hammy because Leonard Vole is the one acting, not Power! For 95% of the film, the character is dissembling, only showing his true colors at the end. Of course it looks hammy: Vole isn\u0027t a born actor like his wife. And to all those know-it-alls who called this film mediocre and predictable, I look forward to your upcoming film projects which I\u0027m sure will be paragons of excellence and worthy to be set alongside classics of the golden age.",

      "reviewBody": "This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it\u0027s still up there for one of their stronger movies. It\u0027s not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.\n\n TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",

This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.",

      "reviewBody": "I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn\u0027t work that well. Then came Pixar with it\u0027s revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven\u0027t felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don\u0027t think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it\u0027s definitely up there among Pixar\u0027s finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll like it and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hug \u0027em all as soon as the credits roll.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you\u0027ve seen it, you know you\u0027ve seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her \"typical teenager\" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari\u0027s character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His \"purpose\" in the film, unlike anyone else\u0027s, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to \"move\" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",

      "name": "Epic",
      "reviewBody": "What impresses me the most about the film, as the title makes apparent, is that it\u0027s a German made film about a German U-boat. Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.\n\nI love the flow and pacing of the Director\u0027s Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula \"first major plot point at minute 12\" cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I\u0027m interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.\n\nThe underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.\n\nAnd despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it\u0027s a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.\n\nJurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I\u0027ve ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he\u0027s forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.\n\nThe rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film\u0027s characters and their portrayals. It\u0027s both disappointing and satisfying that I\u0027m not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I\u0027ve reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these \"heroes\", the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.\n\nAnother aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these \"talked about\" scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.\n\nI can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film\u0027s lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I\u0027ll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",

      "reviewBody": "High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff\u0027s ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there\u0027s usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people). \n\nHere he finds a middle ground- the story is taken from a hard-boiled detective novel, the kind you could probably buy for a quarter or fifty cents in the old days- as he tells of two stories interconnected at the hip, both with detail a commercial Hollywood director would brush off. The first is of businessman Gondo (Toshiro Mifune, with his usual bravura presence, but with enough nuanced and quiet moments for two movies), who is about to close a deal to get the shoe company he\u0027s worked for for years, when he gets a phone call. There\u0027s been a kidnapping- not his son, but his chauffeur\u0027s by default. Backed into a corner without options, he gets together 30 million he really can\u0027t afford, and gives it to the kidnapper(s). The police, meanwhile, are not about to give up, and start digging for clues with an in-depth investigation that goes to probe every possibility: the chauffeur\u0027s son used as a partial witness with drawings; a car; a trolly car; all this leads to nothing and everything, leading to a third act that\u0027s as riveting as the first two.\n\nAlthough the acting by everyone involved, cop characters included (Tatsuya Nakadai and Yutaka Sada are surprisingly good, the later even with limited screen time), Kurosawa keeps the film deliberately paced. Another director (more modern perhaps, but maybe not) might cut to the chase quicker, cutting past most of the investigation details, and even the emotional high-points in the first act. But Kurosawa is as interested in the nature and details of what the police do as he is with the compositions, which are constructed and framed as only an artist would do. The film creates a superb juxtaposition as well- Mifune\u0027s Gondo is enraged about what will happen with his money, but his morals stand above everything in his business affairs. Meanwhile, the cops here aren\u0027t cruel and unforgiving, but professionals trying to crack a case that the audience can hang onto. And then when the \"seedy\" underbelly of the city comes into view, it\u0027s looked on with at least some compassion by Kurosawa, and it\u0027s not too over-the-top.\n\nIf all your looking for is thrill after thrill, like in Sanjuro or even Hidden Fortress, look elsewhere- the violence, by the way, is kept to a low level for this one (it\u0027d even be quite suitable for kids, if they don\u0027t mind the subtitles and quintessential intensity in the Japanese style of film acting). But for tight, often gripping suspense in the IL\u0027 \u0027whodunit\u0027 mystery tale, this is a keeper. Manipulative, perhaps, yet in the hands of a master it\u0027s an exemplary deal. And, in the end, it even provides a sad, existential kind of conclusion as good and evil become blurred as the kidnapper looks through glass at the disillusioned Gondo. It\u0027s one of the great endings in world cinema. A+",

      "reviewBody": "How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you\u0027ve seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you\u0027ve been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that\u0027s me.\n\nNotwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to \"move\" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan\u0027s room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That\u0027s for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don\u0027t know and I don\u0027t care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don\u0027t watch this film if you\u0027re looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don\u0027t even skip this film thinking it\u0027s children\u0027s movie  no it isn\u0027t. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people\u0027s lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.\n\nOkay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it\u0027s two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They\u0027re there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.\n\nAamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That\u0027s the surprise but you don\u0027t miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027d say go and watch the film. I wouldn\u0027t recommend if you\u0027re addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.",

The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.\n\nNone of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.\n\nAnother nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.\n\nIn the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",

      "reviewBody": "It\u0027s hard to get your head around the fact that \u0027Reservoir Dogs\u0027 has been around for ten years. It\u0027s almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another \"dog\" movie from the same era that I saw, \u0027Man Bites Dog\u0027, that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway\u0027s \u0027The Cook The Thief His Wife \u0026 Her Lover\u0027. Okay, I hope it\u0027s good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna\u0027s sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It\u0027s impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I\u0027ve seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - \u0027In The Soup\u0027), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - \u0027Thelma \u0026 Louise\u0027), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - \u0027At Close Range\u0027), there is a lot of depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal \"Tarantinoesque\" movies we\u0027ve had to endure since \u0027Pulp Fiction\u0027. His imitators just simply don\u0027t have a clue!\n\nSimply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!",

The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character\u0027s name sounds like Aldo Ray and I\u0027m sure that\u0027s no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970\u0027s sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino\u0027s trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He\u0027s clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don\u0027t read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That\u0027s how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time.

The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn\u0027t even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.\n\nMatt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will\u0027s talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will\u0027s intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.\n\nYes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.\n\nThe writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt\u0027s best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet\u0027s Society.\n\nIf your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it\u0027s time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.\n\nThis one is a keeper in my movie library.",

Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.\n\nThe Space Odyssey is not something one can just \"go and see\". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don\u0027t think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it\u0027s genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring \u0027Also spracht Zarathustra\u0027 by Richard Strauss and \u0027Blue Danube\u0027 by Johann Strauss.\n\nTake all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.\n\nOr maybe I\u0027m just plain crazy...",

      "reviewBody": "I respect and admire this movie, even though (and perhaps because) it is complex, occasionally irritating and often very hard to take. Frankly, I avoided seeing it for a long time, but now am glad I did. To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is, I think, to miss the point. Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs, the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness, greed, corruption, desperation, and the pervasiveness/banality of media, among many other things.\n\nThe subtleties of the text are communicated, first and foremost, by superb acting. The performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory. In particular, I was knocked out by Burstyn, who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning, but who manages by the end to convey her character\u0027s utter devastation in the truest, most heartbreaking manner imaginable. The others are absolutely perfect as well; I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans (may he eschew \"scary movies\" forevermore). Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film, with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top, and she delivers not a single false note throughout.\n\nMy only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the split-screen and jump-cut techniques, which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious, respectively. That being said, overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate. The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed, and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances (thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet).\n\nIn sum, regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you, this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer. Give it a chance, and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction (spiritual and otherwise). It is a punishing but unforgettable experience. I\u0027m not sure whether I\u0027d necessarily recommend it or not; it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and, ultimately, tragic. For my part, while I don\u0027t expect to watch this film very often in the future, I\u0027m sure glad it\u0027ll be on the shelf.",

      "reviewBody": "John \"Scottie\" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn\u0027t mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she\u0027s obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson\u0027s obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... \n\nVertigo is Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D\u0027Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. \n\nVery much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson\u0027s fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante\u0027s Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. \n\nTechnically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann\u0027s score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart\u0027s ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn\u0027t harnessed on too many other occasions. \n\nVertigo is a film that I myself wasn\u0027t too taken with on my first viewing, it\u0027s only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang\u0027s highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. \n\nEven though M was Lang\u0027s (and Germany\u0027s) first sound film, many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920\u0027s. While most early \"talkies\" return films to their static, visually monotonous, stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium, M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous, off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film\u0027s editing, particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting, also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course, many of the film\u0027s sound effects are also imaginative and memorable, none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film\u0027s central character, the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert (magnificently played by Peter Lorre). \n\nSound is also an important contributor to M\u0027s rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster, creepily intoning to his next victim, Elsie Beckmann, \"You have a very pretty ball.\" Not only is Beckert\u0027s shadow a bow toward Lang\u0027s expressionist artistic roots, but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is, among us, the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing, albeit monstrous, member. Another example of Lang\u0027s use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie\u0027s absence from them: an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table, the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie\u0027s mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter\u0027s arrival, the attic play area that awaits Elsie\u0027s return from school. Most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert\u0027s assault and murder of the innocent child, representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie\u0027s ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.\n\nBeyond its technical brilliance, the keys to M\u0027s lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert\u0027s twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and \"trial.\" Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer, Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. To be sure, the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who, beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry, capture Beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today, Beckert\u0027s accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the \"monster\" in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. \n\nConsidering the heinousness of Beckert\u0027s crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again, this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert\u0027s unkempt \"court appointed\" defense attorney and Beckert\u0027s own impassioned monologue, Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks, dresses, and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover, the letter \"M\" chalked on Beckert\u0027s back by one of his pursuers not only stands for \"murderer\" but also alludes to God\u0027s marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil, it in fact represents God\u0027s warning to Cain\u0027s flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance, but to leave justice in God\u0027s hands. Translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame), God\u0027s hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert \"in the name of the Law.\"",

      "reviewBody": "If I would I\u0027ve seen this movie in 2016, it certainly would have been in my list of best movies. If you\u0027re going to this movie thinking Aamir will be flexing and showcasing his acting prowess then well and good but the girls are the highlight of the movie, hands down. SCRIPT - Major props to bringing out a story which is inspiring and one which India needs right now. The story is kept grounded in reality. No over-the-top gimmicks. The songs blend in very well with the premise. None of the scenes linger on for a long period of time. There was a very natural flow to the story which helped engage the audience for 2 hours and 41 minutes. Even movies like Mary Kom or Bhaag Milkha Bhaag started to drag by the end but hats off to Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain. I have said this that dialogue shouldn\u0027t seem like dialogue unless it is a musical or a re-imagining of a play. The dialogue in this movie is a lesson as to how dialogue should be used. Little nods and grunts and expressions serve more than an explanatory conversation. I am not a fan of narration and I wasn\u0027t really liking it here either. It was fine for the light-hearted scenes but the serious scenes required silence but I can give it a pass. The only scene which felt a bit off is where Mahavir gets locked up in a room before the final fight. If it didn\u0027t happen in reality then it was really unnecessary. DIRECTION - Chillar Party was a movie with some serious message but was a little preachy and Bhootnath Returns went full preachy. Nitesh Tiwari toned down that preaching to a very natural level in this movie. Every single topic that has happened or still happens in a family was touched upon. Beginning from the sleaziness of men to child-marriage to the sacrifice parents make, everything was utilised to the advantage of the movie. None of that brought the movie to a halt. The first half of the movie had a good amount of comedy and that gelled into the second half with ease. The thing that many might not notice that there are no pay-off scenes except for the last scene. If the audience reaches a peak before the ending then the pay-off wouldn\u0027t have a solid effect, if used multiple times. Pay-off scenes are those scenes where the characters are shown to be doing things in extra slow-motion to have an orgasmic effect on the audience and the director cleverly used it at the end in order to give proper tribute to the art and the character. FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY - This section needed a category of it\u0027s own and quite deservedly. I saw Mary Kom, Sultan and Saala Khadoos which had extensive fight scenes and all of the movies had extremely lack-lustre fight scenes. The camera moved too much in order to cover up the actor/actresses\u0027 incapability to fight. In comparison to all those movies, here the camera just followed the fighters. No wide-shots of the fight from the audience\u0027s perspective because that allows the stunt double to come in. All the fights had the actresses in the scene and hats off to all of them for their dedication. ACTING - Like I said before, the best performance among some amazing performances was of the newcomer Fatima Sana Shaikh. That said, it will really be unjust to name one performance as the best performance because everyone was amazing in this movie. Aamir Khan, Sakshi Tanwar, Sanya Malhotra, Aparshakti Khurana,Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar,Ritwik Shore and Girish Kulkarni gave amazing performances. As Aamir had put on so much weight, that altered his physicality a lot which enhanced his performance to another level. Sakshi Tanwar should be doing more movies. She gave a very subdued and nuanced performance. Sanya Malhotra as the grown up Babita had very few scenes but her eyes spoke when she didn\u0027t have any dialogue. Zaira Wasim and Sulhani Bhatnagar were awesome, just awesome. I was in awe how they are able to emote so much at their age. Ritwik Shore and Aparshakti Khurana together made Omkar a memorable character. I think they had some of the best scenes in the entire movie. I wanted to kill Girish Kulkarni after Ugly and after this I still want to kill him and that\u0027s a compliment. The side actors who formed the audience and little roles like the Dangal organiser and the guy who had sleazy theatre also gave substance to the movie. FINAL VERDICT - I am sure everyone has seen this movie by now and if you haven\u0027t then please do. It\u0027s a complete movie and it is very rare to see a complete movie, without gimmicks nowadays. I loved how they had such eye for detail because they gave that damaged effect to Aamir\u0027s ear. Many wouldn\u0027t notice it but it\u0027s great to that they did to provide authenticity to the character and the movie. It\u0027s a 10/10 for me and one of the best movies of 2016.",

Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its a pleasant surprise to see the man behind \"The Mask\" playing such a quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate.\n\nEternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts. especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.\n\nwell-done!",

      "reviewBody": "The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal. He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters. News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane\u0027s life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune. Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died. The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud\u0027 as his last word. Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane\u0027s mansion called Xanadu. It has a sign that says `no trespassing\u0027 that is hung from the outside gate. The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane\u0027s life was the same way. He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom. Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie. The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time. Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie. He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate. I thought that this movie was well done. It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn\u0027t know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized. One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane\u0027s life and career are out of control. Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well. The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable. This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques. I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time.",

      "reviewBody": "One of my favorite foreign language films it Thomas Vinterberg\u0027s \"The Celebration\" (\"Festen\"). It\u0027s an absorbing tale about sexual abuse--abuse that comes out during a birthday party for a beloved family patriarch. Now, with \"The Hunt\" (\"Jagten\"), Vinterberg directs a film where quite the opposite happens--a man is accused of sexual abuse but who is 100% innocent. Had the director always done films denying sexual abuse, folks might have thought him strange but here the brave director allows himself to go in a completely different direction with his movie.\n\nIn his film, Mads Mikkelsen plays Lucas, a divorced father who works at a kindergarten. He seems like a genuinely nice man and is trying to get his life together. He has a new girlfriend, his son wants to come live with him and he has no reason to expect what happens. A very young girl is shown some pornographic material by some older boys and later in passing she tells another teacher that she has seen Lucas\u0027 penis when she actually didn\u0027t. Some folks investigate and ask leading questions--and suddenly there is a bit of hysteria as the community assumes Lucas is guilty--even his so-called friends. And, no matter what he does, he cannot PROVE he never did anything.\n\nSo is the film any good? Well, based on it now being on IMDb\u0027s Top 250 list (at number 133), it\u0027s obvious a lot of folks loved the film. With a current score of 8.3, it\u0027s not at all surprising it would be nominated for the Oscar. As for me, I thought the film was terrific and thought-provoking. It made its point very well by using VERY vivid scenes involving the community literally tormenting Lucas. You can\u0027t help but feel affected by the drama--thanks to the script by Tobias Lindholm and Thomas Vinterberg himself.\n\nI did have one problem with the film--and this is why I didn\u0027t score it a 10. Although I think such a theme is great stuff for older kids and teens to watch with their folks, there are a few graphic scenes that were unnecessary for the film and which would probably make many of these parents not show the movie to their families. I think the kids need to see the violence against Lucas but the sex scene and photo weren\u0027t really needed in the film. A very light trimming would have made this a great film for ages 12 and older. Now, because it\u0027s rated R in the US, it\u0027s unlikely these younger viewers would get to see it. This film needs to be seen by a wide audience as it\u0027s very, very well made and worth seeing.\n\nBy the way, in many ways, this film is like a dramatization of what occurred in the very famous McMartin Pre-School case here in America. Apparently, some very unqualified interviewers screwed up a case and soon had half the school accused of sexual abuse. Some of the stories they reported were downright insane (such as their victimizers being able to fly). Many folks were prosecuted and only later did folks realize what had occurred--a serious rush to judgment. And, as there was no real proof, the accused were all acquitted--but only after years and years of investigations and trials. And, in one case, one of the accused spent five years in jail despite no ultimate conviction.\n\nAlso, if you are curious about me, I used to work with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators as a therapist. I am NOT minimizing sexual abuse claims in my review of the film. Too many women are ignored or treated like dirt when they are victims--I\u0027ve seen this myself. It\u0027s just the unqualified and irresponsible interviews with very small children that bothers me. I\u0027ve worked with many folks in the field and saw that most interviewers (at least back in the 1980s and 90s) were woefully untrained and potentially dangerous because of this.",

      "reviewBody": "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80\u0027s ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford\u0027s novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins \u0026 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. \n\nA superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick\u0027s brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D\u0027Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.\n\nThe film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It\u0027s the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D\u0027Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman\u0027s brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman\u0027s head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. \n\nThe second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman\u0027s camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy\u0027s Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.\n\nThe film is Staney Kubrick\u0027s best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80\u0027s, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there\u0027s excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen\u0027s of body\u0027s out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city\u0027s are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn\u0027t even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. \n\n\u0027Born to Kill\u0027 - written on Joke\u0027s helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Roger Thornhill is an advertising man. However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else. When he tries to find out what\u0027s going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive. Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall. However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.\n\nRightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today\u0027s thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense. Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing. The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc. The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.\n\nThe dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock. Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings. Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good. The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at least\n\none key scene) but it all stands together well. The acting is also perfect, Grant\u0027s rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock\u0027s best everyman characters. Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice\u0027 Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character. The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill\u0027s mother is perfection!\n\nOver 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect. A wonderful thriller for young and old - no sex, no swearing, all thrills.",

      "reviewBody": "Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik\u0027s work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema. \n\nThe fact that this film was regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made (rightfully so) sparked genuine curiosity to give this flick a full viewing and while I have large issues with the film, the experience as a whole was both satisfying and a learning experience. \n\nThis story centers on \"Alex\" our main protagonist and his gang of hoodlums set in a not so distant, dystopian Great Britain. The beginning portion unfolds Alex\u0027s dark and twisted soul as we watch him and his gang fight, rape, and kill. When he\u0027s eventually caught, he undergoes controversial \"treatment\" to be cured of his dark soul.\n\nI first appreciated the inmate concepts of this story and the type of questions the story attempted to raise to the audience. Furthermore, much of the psychological ideologies surrounding freedom, choice, good vs evil, and selfishness were extremely thought-provoking. It had a way of making me feel self-exploratory despite the character\u0027s complete inability to relate with (hopefully) any viewer. \n\nPerformances were top notch; especially from the lead: Malcom McDowell. His performance felt so authentic there\u0027s never a single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character. As always, Stanley Kubrick directs the hell out of this. His commanding and authoritative shooting style is apparent in every frame of the picture and he does a wonderful job at sucking the viewer into this terrible world to the point of enthrallment. \n\nWhile all these positives make for a great movie-going experience and when Kubrick is at the director\u0027s helm not much can go wrong, the film\u0027s biggest downfall is indeed its controversy. Disturbing subject matter in this piece is indeed vital to the essence of the story but taking off the gloves when it comes to fighting, rape, and killing (especially the rape) make this so incredibly disturbing that it\u0027s difficult to muscle through. I found that A Clockwork Orange was not only offense because of its disturbing content, it was personally offensive in so many ways. Frankly, these extremely rare and offensive movie experiences are not quite the reason I enjoy films in the first place; stories can still be thought-provoking while not morally offend and damage the viewer internally. In addition, a viewer looking to study the work of Stanley Kubrick can still experience some of cinema\u0027s greatest and transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened.\n\nIt\u0027s understandable that not everyone feels this way; just as stated before, opinions about this film are all across the board. As time has passed however, A Clockwork Orange has stood out has one of Kubrick\u0027s finest and has been adored by die-hard fans so much its fan base has grown over the years. \n\nThe best advice to give is to see it for yourself. Much like all other Kubrick films, relying on anyone\u0027s opinion won\u0027t help one bit. Seeing it and deciding for yourself is the best course of action. That being said, despite it\u0027s strong artistic merit, I wouldn\u0027t recommend seeing it simply because of the morally offensive and sickening content that most don\u0027t appreciate. Overall, it\u0027s been the hardest one to review in a long time because it\u0027s not a simple: see it or don\u0027t see it. There\u0027s much more to this picture than that. If you do decide to see it though, be warned and well prepared. If not, that\u0027s probably just fine too.",

I\u0027m sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.\n\nAs for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him. I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs. The evil men were EVIL (\"so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel\" to quote Mike Meyers). The bumbling men were endearing. The music was great. \n\nIt was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think). Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.\n\nOh, and I never saw \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\", for whatever that\u0027s worth.",

      "reviewBody": "It is post-war Rome and much of the city\u0027s residents are impoverished and desperate for work. One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family. Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief\u0027, Vittorio de Sica\u0027s gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work. \n\nde Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs. The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true. The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again. \n\n`The Bicycle Thief\u0027 personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life. While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important. `The Bicycle Thief\u0027 has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.\n\n--Shelly",

      "reviewBody": "Singin\u0027 in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it\u0027s a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they\u0027re referring to.\n\nThe star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O\u0027Connor makes the most of his \"second banana\" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break into films. \n\nThe three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly\u0027s \"Singin\u0027 in the Rain\" classic; all three in the \"Good Mornin\u0027\" number; O\u0027Connor\u0027s \"Make \u0027Em Laugh\"; and Kelly and Reynolds in \"You Were Meant for Me.\" The masterpiece however may be the \"Gotta Dance\" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charissejust perfect. Also great fun are O\u0027Connor and Kelly in \"Fit as a Fiddle\" and \"Moses Supposes.\"\n\nThere are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood\u0027s race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the \"Beautiful Girl\" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. \n\nJean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.\n\nThe great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly \"lip syncing\" for Hagen, it\u0027s really Hagen\u0027s voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the \"I Would, Would You\" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing \"Singin\u0027 in the Rain\" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can\u0027t tell who is lip syncing whose voice.\n\nLots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen\u0027s Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It\u0027s also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams \"I LOVE YOU\" it\u0027s a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman\u0027s diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.\n\nA great film!",

      "reviewBody": "\"A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.\" -Mark Twain\n\n\u0027Classic\u0027 seems to be the word used to describe \"Scarface\", Brian DePalma\u0027s 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida\u0027s drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film \u0027an epic gangster classic\u0027 or \u0027eptiome of gangster films.\u0027 When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.\n\nFirst off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma\u0027s directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. \u0027Tragedy\u0027 would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it\u0027s drug usage, it\u0027s violence, it\u0027s dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn\u0027t make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.\n\nNext on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a \u0027gangster film\u0027. It has it\u0027s share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It\u0027s not like \"Aliens\"- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. \n\nThis being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn\u0027t think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma\u0027s direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping\u0027 fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in \"Grease 2\" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony\u0027s sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina\u0027s torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. \n\nThis reviewer learned one main thing when watching \"Scarface\" for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey\u0027s on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real \"Scarface.\"",

      "reviewBody": "\"Taxi Driver\" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the \u002770\u0027s. He already isn\u0027t a stable person to begin with (he\u0027s a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea\u0027s of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\nBeauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. \n\nThe story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.\n\nThe movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous \u0027You talking\u0027 to me?\u0027 sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.\n\nIt\u0027s still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes \"Taxi Driver\" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the \u0027classic\u0027-status. \n\nYet another essential \u002770\u0027s viewing.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u0027s Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain\n\nFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain. But it\u0027s popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain\u0027, obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn\u0027t win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.\n\nI consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u0027s film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie\u0027s mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie\u0027s apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven\u0027t noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.\n\nThe atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.\n\nCamera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie\u0027s mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie\u0027s father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino\u0027s red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.\n\nAudrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can\u0027t imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It\u0027s wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie\u0027s mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director\u0027s choice, so I don\u0027t hold her responsible for that.\n\n Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie\u0027s pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer\u0027s door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key\u0027s silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn\u0027t been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie\u0027s heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old\u0027s man face, a close-up of Amélie\u0027s hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.\n\n Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.\n\nIn my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion.",

Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O\u0027Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027m going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O\u0027Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O\u0027Toole\u0027s eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a \"silly movie\" Wow, I had Michael Apted\u0027s quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don\u0027t know what he meant. I love this film.",

      "reviewBody": "Small time conmen Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman unwittingly scam a runner for Chicago main man Doyle Lonnegan. When Luther is murdered, Hooker goes on the run and seeks out Luther\u0027s old friend Henry Gondorff to help him put together a major sting to take revenge on Lonnegan. However with so much heat on Hooker and the stakes so high can they pull it off and get away clean?\n\nAlmost a follow up to Butch and Sundance, this film partners the stars of the day Newman and Redford to good effect. The story is a little less fun but still very enjoyable to watch as it builds to a great finale. The use of chapters ran the risk of fragmenting the film into bits but instead it really helps set it out and makes it more manageable. Although it is not as light hearted and jovial as the theme music suggests it still manages to flow nicely with the slightly darker drama not spoiling anything but only serving to make it feel more grown up.\n\nThe cast are all very good and make the film easy to watch. Redford comes off the best in terms of characters and his role really suits both his carefree attitude (the start of the film) but also his more serious side (the rest of the film). Newman has a lesser role that perhaps doesn\u0027t suit him quite as well, but he does have several really good scenes (the hustles) where he does very good work. Shaw\u0027s accent is a little heavy at first but I got used to it and it worked for me and he was a really good foil for Redford/Newman. The support cast including Durning, Walston, Gould, Jones and others all do good work.\n\nThe direction and use of music is really good and the sense of period is well crafted and doesn\u0027t just feel like it was painted on. I\u0027m not sure if it deserved Best Picture or not because I don\u0027t know what the rest of the field was for that year but it is a really enjoyable film that is quite fun to watch several times even 30 years later  and isn\u0027t that the main thing?",

Seen in context of its premier in 1927, Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history. Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great, and in particular, Metropolis. A great film is one that stirs the imagination, leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever, forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life, and achieves a kind of immortality. Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria. Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings, halluciatory scenes, and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope, most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions. There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria. Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual, as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups. Lastly, Metropolis has stood the test of time. It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre. The story itself is simple,a Biblical allegory, about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen. The film is anything but simple. It is immense, and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us.",

Therefore he begins to work in cooperation with the people... accomplishing something that nobody in the office had the nerve to do before.\n\nI consider Ikiru to be Kurosawa\u0027s first truly excellent film.

      "name": "The best classic spaghetti western in the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood trilogy!",
      "reviewBody": "For a Few Dollars More (1965) is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite personal classic western flicks ever! It is my third favorite in \"The Man with No Name\" Trilogy. I grew up watching this film and it was the first Clint Eastwood western movie I ever saw, I fall immediately in love with it and I just love this movie. It is Sergio Leone\u0027s best western film of all time my favorite. It is entraining and brilliant western flick with a great original epic story, great cast and the acting is fantastic. You have a great shoot outs, the music score is original epic. I always enjoy this film. It is my favorite Eastwood western movie. \n\nIn my opinion It is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood\u0027s classic film that they ever made together. Westerns like this film doesn\u0027t exit this days anymore. I have enjoyed For a Few Dollars More a lot. I love this one to death. The film is very entertained, is not boring and It has a good plot and story to tell. The characters, the action shooting sequences are just amazing and awesome. Sergio Leone does what he wanted to do with the film, and become one of the greatest epic classic western movies. I love this movie to death and it is my favorite film! There are other western films that Clint Eastwood made and directed but this one will be one of his best films in the history ever.\n\nThe first film was more about one hero but in this film there are two heroes. The bullets, the shooting is outstanding. The gun fights are awesome. This is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert, For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera.\n\nThe film is intelligent when Col. Douglas Mortimer suggested that the way to break the gang will be easy with one man from the inside of the gang (Monco) , because his younger. The story telling from El Indio about a carpenter who made a big closet were the safe was hiding in it was just plain brilliant.Monco breaks one of Indio\u0027s friends out of prison and is admitted to the gang, to prove his loyalty was awesome. The watch that Indio opens during the gun fight scenes and when the song stops by the watch he draw his gun and shoot anyone in the gun fight with him that was so awesome. The last showdown between Col. Douglas Mortimer and El Indio when the song stopped was TERRIFIC!\n\nWhy I love this movie? Simply because of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. I love Lee Van Cleef so much in here because he plays the good guy, he kills bunch of outlaws whit his riffle. He befriends Monco and he kills El Inido on the end. He doesn\u0027t split the reward with Monco , but he lets him have it, the money on a honest way. Clint Eastwood as Monco did a fantastic job in one of his best performances as Bounty Killer Monco. He also kills bunch of outlaws, he also shoot Mortimer\u0027s hat, he never shoots an Innocent or unarmed person, that is why I love this actor and his character so much. Gian Maria Volonté did a good job on another style he also never shoot unarmed person, he only did that once for a women he fall in love. Mortimer\u0027s sister, on the end of the film it was reveled why Col. Douglas Mortimer was hunting El Indio and his gang. He was doing it for both: Justice and Revenge, while Monco just wanted to get money and become rich, but he changed his mind after he saw how Indio is evil and cruel person. The gun fight between Col. Douglas Mortimer and Juan Wild - The Hunchback ( Klaus Kinski) in the bar was fantastic! How Col. Douglas Mortimer killed him. I love this film to death I love it! Sergio Leone did a fantastic job directing this awesome flick in fact I think it is his masterpiece. The film that changed the western movies today and I love the music score from Ennio Morricone. The dialogue and the script was amazing, the weapons used in this film are awesome and they are used well. Action is plenty in the film.\n\nWhat else do you want in an spaghetti Western film like this at all?! The fact is this is the greatest western ever made in the history. I love this film to death! It is my third favorite film in the Dollars trilogy. This movie is a perfect 10 it is my personal favorite western movie.",

I hadn\u0027t been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.\n\nI\u0027m mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see \"A Separation\". I will be shocked if this movie doesn\u0027t win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I\u0027ve seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi\u0027s story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.\n\nIf this movie reminds me of anything, it is \"Ladri di Biciclette\" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly \"simple\" story setup. But then \"A Separation\" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it.",

The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor\u0027s Brigid O\u0027Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.\n\nI personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them.

The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a \"classic\". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. \n\nJack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company\u0027s office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. \n\nThe movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.",

The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s\u0027pose it\u0027s in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" rises to the top of the pile easily.\n\nYes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.\n\nThe writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe\u0027s problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there\u0027s not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing \"Ponette,\" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in \"Mockingbird\" received my best child performance ever awards. \"Ponette\" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn\u0027t diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.\n\nPeck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.\n\nIf you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen \"Mockingbird,\" I pity you. You\u0027ve passed on one of Hollywood\u0027s most unforgettable experiences.",

      "reviewBody": "When people watch the Oscars, they don\u0027t usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer\u0027s mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film\u0027s story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn\u0027t have a great future ahead of them.\n\nBased on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn\u0027t know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal\u0027s nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal\u0027s story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.\n\nIncendies already had great source material. I\u0027ve praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It\u0027s impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can\u0027t imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there\u0027s some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn\u0027t autobiographical.\n\nFurthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve\u0027s advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne\u0027s lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn\u0027t receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.\n\nThere are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could\u0027ve lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",

      "reviewBody": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. \n\nI loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy\u0027s dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit \u0026 charm along with Indy\u0027s usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn\u0027t by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix\u0027 laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.\n\nThis is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg\u0027s output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn\u0027t mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. \n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There\u0027s a bit of kissing/banter, and it\u0027s implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there\u0027s ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn\u0027t need another sequel after third release. There\u0027s nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy\u0027s Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it\u0027s up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.\n\nThe chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.\n\nIt should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.\n\n100/10",

      "reviewBody": "Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They\u0027re all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.\n\nThis story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don\u0027t get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.\n\nThe movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other\u0027s unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story\u0027s strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That\u0027s all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you\u0027re never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.\n\nL.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation\u0027s finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It\u0027s so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.",

      "reviewBody": "\u0027Heat,\u0027 a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some. With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann\u0027s sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, \u0027Heat\u0027 is arguably one of the best crime dramas.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley. Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters. While following Hanna\u0027s personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna\u0027s marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the \"remnants of dead people.\" A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna\u0027s story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley\u0027s story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together. When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic. To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.\n\nIn addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters. And the cast is one of the best, at that. DeNiro. Little more needs to be said. Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover. And, despite his life of crime, McCauley\u0027s human side shows through. He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist. His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady. Pacino. Equally without need of praise. As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships. He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley. Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be. Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity. Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine\u0027s daughter Lauren. As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro. In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.\n\nAnd Michael Mann\u0027s direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly. He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic. The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever. Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable. And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.\n\nBecause of these and other well done aspects, \u0027Heat\u0027 is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that\u0027s what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. \n\nRashomon pioneered Kurosawa\u0027s dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai\u0027s wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai\u0027s spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai\u0027s version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn\u0027t want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. \n\nThe concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10",

And from the start it wasn\u0027t a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.\n\nVery interesting to see Powell\u0027s trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.\n\nMichael Kamen\u0027s upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky. Listen closely and see if you get reminded of \"Singing in the Rain\" or Beethoven\u0027s \"Symphony no. 9\" as the movie goes on.\n\nSome of the best lines ever... e.g. \"After all you speeches, you\u0027re nothing but a common thief\"... \"I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I\u0027m moving into kidnapping, you should be more polite\"\n\nGrade A+\n\n10/10",

His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot.

Goyer is quality stuff, it\u0027s true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson\u0027s character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. \n\nNolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne\u0027s backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there\u0027s little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.\n\nOf course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne\u0027s skin, it doesn\u0027t hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne\u0027s public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.\n\nAnd the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It\u0027s very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It\u0027s not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne\u0027s mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne\u0027s arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It\u0027s wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his \u0027fear gas\u0027 are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra\u0027s Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. \n\nNolan\u0027s knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it\u0027s environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don\u0027t think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan\u0027s realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There\u0027s even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What\u0027s not to love here?\n\n(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)\n\nOverall, I\u0027d have to label Batman Begins \u0027The must see movie of the summer\u0027 - it\u0027s a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale\u0027s powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy\u0027s sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it\u0027s own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.\n\n-10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my \"People\u0027s Choice Award\" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar \"they-couldn\u0027t-have-been-more-different\" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as \"Dumb and Dumber To\" and \"The Three Stooges\" elicited a virtual double-take.\n\nBut I couldn\u0027t help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it\u0027s based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There\u0027s definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who\u0027s streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That\u0027s not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.\n\nThe two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen\u0027s \"b.s. artist\" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen\u0027s performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what\u0027s called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he\u0027s Danish.\n\nI\u0027m allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I\u0027d say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.\n\nThe music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there\u0027s always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn\u0027t get any better than it gets here - Ali\u0027s piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie\u0027s ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he\u0027s filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali\u0027s hands, which should clinch it.)\n\nTop everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.\n\nSo congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can\u0027t deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.",

You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode.

      "reviewBody": "There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn\u0027t anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.\n\nKevin Costner tries hard but he just doesn\u0027t get it. Dances With Wolves wasn\u0027t really a western. It wasn\u0027t even an anti-western. It was more like a political indictment of the actions of the Americans of the time. For all that I did enjoy it.\n\nMost of the others since Unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse, but the story is just generic pap. Nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.\n\nI will grant that Deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn\u0027t a movie.\n\nThat\u0027s why I believe that Unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. I won\u0027t get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how Clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. Cuz that\u0027s a load of crap. The script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. What it is, is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. There are only shades of grey.\n\nIt is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. Life was comparatively cheap and most people didn\u0027t have much hope of justice. The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.\n\nGood guys didn\u0027t wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. Some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. Little Bill mocks English Bob\u0027s self-promotion, but at the same time he knocks Bob down he builds himself up. He doesn\u0027t bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. He isn\u0027t motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. It\u0027s more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.\n\nWilliam Munny is a killer, plain and simple. He has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. He changed for his wife, but like many changes it wasn\u0027t permanent. He won\u0027t sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.\n\nRather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud.",

      "reviewBody": "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)\n\nIt was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn\u0027t end there however...\n\nThis film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali\u0027s face, and Zahra\u0027s tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.\n\nWe see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali\u0027s Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.\n\nThere is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.\n\nLater in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.\n\nThe film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour. This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.\n\nThe film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.\n\nMissing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.\n\nI truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!\n\nReviewed by Ollie",

      "reviewBody": "Come and See , well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child\u0027s perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.\n\n I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.\n\nThe acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you\u0027d expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you\u0027ll have to see.\n\nCome and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table.",

      "reviewBody": "Legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond that Won Oscar and another 13 wins \u0026 8 nominations . Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters\u0027 retaliation . \n\nRightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I\u0027m through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O\u0027Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . \n\nThe motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It\u0027s the kind of movie where you know what\u0027s coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same .",

      "reviewBody": "What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki\u0027s work, but in Howl\u0027s Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.\n\nIt has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.\n\nHe achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.\n\nThe story is fantastic - I haven\u0027t read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki\u0027s work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.\n\nI can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!",

      "name": "Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic",
      "reviewBody": "Ran is probably cinema\u0027s greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare\u0027s King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. \n\nThe story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son\u0027s audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son\u0027s impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. \n\nThe brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can\u0027t help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn\u0027t feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa\u0027s brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. \n\nA must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",

It\u0027s partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill . The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered \u0027putting all the rotten eggs in one basket\u0027 as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .\n\nThis exciting story contains thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting and support , as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character , ¨The Cooler King¨ , remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind , James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout , furthermore , James Garner as American officer , the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum, among others . Colorful, atmospheric cinematography shot in Bavaria,Germany, by Daniel Fapp and perfectly remastered . Excellent production design and art direction with evocative sets by Fernando Carrere. Rousing and lively soundtrack , nowadays a classic score, by Elmer Bernstein . This blockbuster is followed by inferior TV sequel with Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch , Ian McShane and directed Jud Taylor who played to Goff in the original version . The motion picture is magnificently directed By John Sturges , author of various classic Western as ¨Escape from Fort Bravo, Gunfight at the OK Corral, The law and Jake Wade, Magnificent seven¨ and also realized another nice wartime film as ¨ The eagle has landed ¨ . Rating : Two thumbs up , essential and indispensable watching , a real must see.",

The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It\u0027s an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to \"act\" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.\n\n\"All About Eve\" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films \"A Face in the Crowd\". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face\u0027s premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.\n\nAnd possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so \"liberated\" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven\u0027t yet seen it, you\u0027ve suffered long enough; don\u0027t wait another day.",

      "reviewBody": "A Beautiful Mind\n\n Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience\u0027s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin\u0027s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he\u0027ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.\n\nJohn Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He\u0027s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.\n\nBut John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia\u0027s a tough disease, folks - it\u0027s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.\n\nRussell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you\u0027ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he\u0027s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he\u0027s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they\u0027re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he\u0027s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren\u0027t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.\n\nAnd he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash\u0027s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that\u0027s the essence of Crowe\u0027s performance. It\u0027s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.\n\nHis supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she\u0027s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn\u0027t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.\n\nAnd yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don\u0027t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I\u0027ll admit it, it got me right here. But it\u0027s okay; I did that old \u0027guy-crying-in-movie-theater\u0027 trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won\u0027t think you\u0027re a girly man.\n\nAt any rate, it\u0027s certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything\u0027s in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",

      "name": "Very good but not without flaws",
      "reviewBody": "Casino is a very good film. If you\u0027re at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you\u0027re at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I\u0027m a huge De Niro fan, and I\u0027m a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.\n\nBut I don\u0027t think that Casino is at all a \"perfect\" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you\u0027re familiar with my reviews, you\u0027ll know that it\u0027s not that high of a score from me--it\u0027s closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I\u0027m going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10\u0027s.\n\nCasino is based on the story of Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein \"secretly\" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It\u0027s roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.\n\nThe film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi\u0027s book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It\u0027s remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.\n\nOne of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.\n\nEventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese\u0027s directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.\n\nThis is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That\u0027s a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.\n\nAnother unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I\u0027ve owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded \"mix tape\" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin\u0027 tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.\n\nPresumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that\u0027s what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein\u0027s suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.\n\nThat Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I\u0027m not sure the final result exactly worked.\n\nOf course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that\u0027s how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it\u0027s a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we\u0027re shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.\n\nBut the slight flaws shouldn\u0027t stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I\u0027d be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.\n\nA special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose \u0027Captain Vidal\u0027 is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu\u0027s quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I\u0027ve seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting \u0027Pale Man\u0027 - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.\n\nBut the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete\u0027s hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one\u0027s death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.\n\nI loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don\u0027t give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro\u0027s greatest work to date.",

      "reviewBody": "From the brilliant \"Walt Disney of Japan\", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that\u0027s simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.\n\nSometimes you feel like you\u0027re not watching an animated children\u0027s movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There\u0027s no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.\n\nMiraculously, Totoro doesn\u0027t talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).\n\nI loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo\u0027s world.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.",

      "reviewBody": "When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",

      "reviewBody": "The story of boxer Jake La Motta from his rising star in the 1940\u0027s through to his own downfall and his eventual living on the cabaret circuit in the present day.\n\nScorsese and De Niro  nobody needs say any more. Whether it be media satire (King of Comedy), small time thugs (Mean Streets) or real gangsta s**t (Goodfellas), the two rarely miss. This was one of their best to date (and probably for ever). The story is fascinating in itself but as an examination of masculinity it excels. The film allows us to watch a man who goes along with all the things he thinks make him a man  even when those characteristics and habits begin to destroy everything he has  his marriage, his realtionships and his career. Combine this with the gripping boxing tale of ups and downs and you have a film that never outstays it\u0027s welcome.\n\nScorsese is on top form  the use of black and white any have been a quality issue, but he uses it well. The fight scenes are other worldly  exaggerated to the extent that it is breathtaking and more shocking than previous boxing scenes in other movies. My favourite effect is the sound editing in the fights where silence and calm seem to descend just before key moments..amazing. The relationship stuff is also gripping and Scorsese handles he human cost just as well as he shows us the physical beatings.\n\nDe Niro is amazing  the method stuff alone is great, but his whole performance is intense. Similarly Moriaty, Pesci and Frank Vincent are excellent  however they all stand in De Niro\u0027s shadow.\n\nOverall  an excellent film on so many levels, as a story, as a examination of masculinity, as a sports film, as a lesson in direction and editing..this excels in so many ways  may it never drop out of the top ten from the twentieth century!",

      "name": "The essence of late 90\u0027s cinema -- hip, highly stylized, VISUAL",
      "reviewBody": "Guy Ritchie\u0027s hip, highly stylized \u0027Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\u0027 is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzle-perfect script/screenplay. While the picture\u0027s main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more\u003e than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it\u0027s also uniformly humorous throughout. It\u0027s important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell \"discounted\" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who \"grow copious amounts of ganja\".\n\n The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn\u0027t even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60\u0027s hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London\u0027s underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period).\n\n Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually \"displaying\" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It\u0027s what the medium is all about -- it\u0027s VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to \"brand\" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It\u0027s hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese\u0027s patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in \u0027Mean Streets\u0027 and \u0027Goodfellas\u0027. But the similarities with Scorsese\u0027s work end there.\n\n Critics\u0027 endless comparisons of Ritchie\u0027s film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle\u0027s \u0027Trainspotting\u0027 stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of \u0027Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\u0027. Ritchie\u0027s film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino\u0027s films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle\u0027s \u0027Trainspotting\u0027 does have a resembling \"feel\" to \u0027LS\u0026TSB\u0027, but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. \u0027Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\u0027 is essential viewing.",

      "name": "The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio\u0027s Crowning Work",
      "reviewBody": "Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he\u0027s contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.\n\nTelling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian\u0027s insight that felt like I was watching \"Intervention\" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone\u0027s Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That\u0027s a testament to Scorsese\u0027s outstanding direction and Terence Winter\u0027s masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They\u0027re like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren\u0027t aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.\n\nA lot of the credit of the film\u0027s overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I\u0027ve never seen him truly \"go for it\" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it\u0027s the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90\u0027s in What\u0027s Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he\u0027d been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It\u0027s a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio\u0027s crowning achievement.\n\nAs the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill\u0027s performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He\u0027s allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he\u0027s not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.\n\nLike any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan\u0027s outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan\u0027s second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she\u0027ll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she\u0027ll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she\u0027s required to be. She\u0027s the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson\u0027s character in Don Jon.\n\nI loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter\u0027s script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn\u0027t make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won\u0027t find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",

      "reviewBody": "This film is a sharp-edged study of the effects of greed on otherwise normal men, and one man in particular: Bogart\u0027s Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold. \n\nThe three have to deal with the lawlessness of central Mexico at the time - bandits were actually on the loose in that country killing anybody with stuff, and taking that stuff. The Federales were a violent solution to a violent problem - killing the bandits after a summary judgement and the bandits having dug their own graves. So our trio not only have to worry about bandits once they strike gold, they have to worry about the darkness of their own souls. \n\nIn the beginning, Bogart\u0027s Fred C. Dobbs is a decent guy who does not take advantage of others. Dobbs only takes his money from the guy that wouldn\u0027t pay and he does share his lottery ticket and is generous with his fellow miners, but as greed begins to take root in him, little by little we see his goodness eaten away. It\u0027s a great credit to the writing and Bogart\u0027s skills that this is done gradually and played out over time. Incidentally, that\u0027s director John Huston \"staking him to a meal\". One of the best director cameos ever (although Polanski in Chinatown is equally great)! \n\nDobbs overestimates himself and the fallibility of human nature. Walter Hustons character freely admits what gold could do to any of them including himself. Dobbs is sure it will never happen to him, but he\u0027s never had anything, so he\u0027s never faced temptation, and when he falls it\u0027s a long way down. \n\nThis may be Tim Holt\u0027s finest performance - it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as a B western star on the RKO lot. Walter Huston as the prospector, minus his dentures and plus a bunch of pounds and with holes in his clothes is not the debonair fellow you are used to seeing in film . If Mary Astor\u0027s character in Dodsworth could have thought this was the future appearance of the man she loved, would she have taken her gondola in the other direction? I guess we\u0027ll never know.\n\nHighly recommended as one of the great character studies in which several characters get studied in detail.",

      "name": "Revelation of Horror",
      "reviewBody": "This is a fine film by a fine director, but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer, in committing to full length film a television story, knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie, for all mankind, but if the reviews I\u0027ve read on this site are any indication, the message has been lost to some degree.\n\nI\u0027ve entitled my review \"Revelation of Horror\", but the horror revealed was not the Holocaust. That had already been revealed, although Kramer\u0027s film certainly lent its emotional impact. The revelation was a deep, true insight into how it happened, and the horror is that it happened in a civilized country. Few on this earth can imagine the true horror of Nazi Germany--I\u0027ve read criticism of Widmark\u0027s Colonel Lawson as too preachy, but the character and the acting conveyed the mission of one who actually saw the horrors, beyond any scope we can identify with.\n\nKramer\u0027s achievement is that everything in this movie reminds us that the Nazi\u0027s used every facet of civilization, no matter how minute, to foster their extermination of their enemies, to inculcate it as an ordinary part of life. That was why judges were chosen to portray the issue of \"obeying orders\" versus \"human decency.\" Herr Rolf is \"forced\" to defend the worst criminals imaginable, and yet his very defense and the principles behind it are abused in the process, used as a weapon against the very law they represent. Thus did the Nazis prevail with the willing acquiescence of the German people, and the abominable disregard of the rest of the world.\n\nThe other horror revealed in this film is the incessant excusing of it. Beyond the obvious pleas of the guilty (\"We didn\u0027t know\", or as one judge says to another, \"Was it possible to kill like that?\") are the multiplicity of subtle excuses: the reminder of centuries\u0027 old German culture, Rolf\u0027s plaintive cry of \"unfairness\" at the showing of the death camp films because of their inflammatory nature, the invocation of \"Lili Marlene\" throughout the film, to name just a few. While the song evokes sadness, a guilty German society meant for it to invoke sadness. Long before Germany had its country destroyed by bombs, it had its soul destroyed by Hitler.\n\nBecause this is a courtroom drama, respecting the sacred role of the Rule of Law in safeguarding humanity, almost every scene, every line is a statement that Nazi Germany perverted the Rule of Law, as did the very defense of the war criminals. But what is principle on a small scale of a single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used to defend the indefensible on an impossibly massive scale. Tracy\u0027s character at the film\u0027s end has a realization that this is so, as well as an awareness that what happened in Germany during the Third Reich was an Aristotelian tragedy for anyone touched by it, even remotely, so that any personal considerations (such as Mrs. Berthold) are made utterly impossible.\n\nRolf\u0027s speech about the guilty responsibility of the rest of the world was valid--but he was indicting the world to save one man. Where have we heard that in our own time? This quality about \"Judgment at Nuremburg\" makes its message forever fresh--and its warnings.",

      "reviewBody": "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano\u0027s character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis\u0027s character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I\u0027am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don\u0027t think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I\u0027m not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don\u0027t like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother\u0027s struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.\n\nWhat begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. \"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I\u0027ve never quite seen before. We\u0027re presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. \n\nThe movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character\u0027s motivations. It\u0027s obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it\u0027s constructed. \n\nOne of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they\u0027re in. That\u0027s not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. \n\nIf there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn\u0027t have changed anything about it. It\u0027s a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don\u0027t miss this one.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It\u0027s a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country\u0027s history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it\u0027s still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it\u0027ll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It\u0027s well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i\u0027m afraid. Similarly, the film doesn\u0027t give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry\u0027s heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don\u0027t know if it\u0027s true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn\u0027t even be noticed by someone who wasn\u0027t around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It\u0027s worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.",

      "name": "Gold is the operative word here.",
      "reviewBody": "The Gold Rush is pure gold. It was Charlie Chaplin\u0027s third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp. \n\nThis movie should be counted among Chaplin\u0027s best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I\u0027ve also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy\u0027s immortal geniuses.\n\nHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college\u0027s silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. \n\n Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven\u0027t even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that\u0027s also on the disc.\n\nThe viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard. On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!\n\nAlso, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD. But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.\n\nThe first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I\u0027ve ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies. \n\nAnd the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they\u0027ve seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.\n\nI don\u0027t say this to sound pretentious. I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted. It\u0027s hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years. \n\nFor example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin\u0027s first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema\u0027s potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously. Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.\n\nThe joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy. This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle\u0027s aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp\u0027s grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.\n\nOne pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing. \n\nWhen Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm. This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD. \n\nThe second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn\u0027t sustain the entire film at the cabin. Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film\u0027s third act. \n\n I don\u0027t want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn\u0027t seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.\n\nMack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat. Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid. From what I\u0027ve seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. \n\n The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today\u0027s more sophisticated stories and special effects. The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia\u0027s true feelings for the Tramp.\n\nBut the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that\u0027s a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today. What a shame.\n\nRating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)",

      "reviewBody": "The year 1974 was very memorable. That year several films were successes which consisted of Francis Coppula\u0027s \"The Godfather:Part II\",Alan Pakula\u0027s political thriller \"The Parallex View\",Robert Aldrich\u0027s \"The Longest Yard\",and not to mention the disaster epics of the day;Irwin Allen\u0027s \"The Towering Inferno\",and Mark Robson\u0027s \"Earthquake\" not to mention the films \"The Conversation\",and \"The Great Gatsby\",\"Lenny\",and \"Blazing Saddles\" to name a few. But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI\u0027s 100 top films of all time.\n\nThe year was 1974. The motion picture is \"Chinatown\". This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970\u0027s. This was the movie that started it all.\n\nJack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70\u0027s directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne\u0027s Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940\u0027s Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film\u0027s alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. \"Chinatown\" was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970\u0027s was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.\n\nThe film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",

Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.\n\nDial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it\u0027s weird in that even though she\u0027s cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he\u0027s trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie.",

      "name": "Great, but far from Bergman\u0027s best",
      "reviewBody": "I find it strange that \"The seventh Seal\" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it\u0027s very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like \"Wild Strawberries\", \"Through a Glass darkly\", \"Persona\", \"Winter light\" and \"Fanny and Alexander\", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God\u0027s silence is much, much better developed in the famous \"Faith Trilogy\", especially \"Through a glass darkly\" and \"Winter light\". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn\u0027t really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many \"comic relief\" moments. Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it\u0027s one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It\u0027s very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman\u0027s movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and \"Wild Strawberries\") with Sven Nykvist. Watch \"Through a glass darkly\" or \"Persona\" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even \"Wild Strawberries\", made shortly after \"The Seventh seal\" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it\u0027s understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it\u0027s time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman\u0027s movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It\u0027s a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don\u0027t limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there\u0027s nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole\u0027 cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.\n\nJosh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he\u0027s ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.\n\nWith its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you\u0027re left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it\u0027s a score that\u0027s frightening and precise.\n\n-Eric Statzer",

And yes, it may be, to some, \"just another fight movie. However, Warrior has the audacity to challenge the cliché\u0027s and still manages to stand out from the rest. Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while. Go see this movie to finish off the summer or forever regret not supporting what is sure to be a classic!",

      "name": "All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...",
      "reviewBody": "There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn\u0027t be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese\u0027s film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane\u0027s already great story.\n\nShutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you\u0027ve read the novel multiple times, you\u0027ll feel like you\u0027re reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing \"the most dangerous patients,\" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.\n\nI often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall\u0027s The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.\n\nAs with Scorsese and DiCaprio\u0027s previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn\u0027t go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That\u0027s not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility\u0027s faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.\n\nHowever, that mood isn\u0027t sacrificed and \"spooky\" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a \"best of\" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my \"Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows\" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he\u0027s quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn\u0027t mean anything though if you don\u0027t have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn\u0027t among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there\u0027s always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.\n\nWith a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn\u0027t rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.\n\nShutter Island isn\u0027t just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I\u0027ve been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I\u0027ve been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those \"in the know.\" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I\u0027ll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in \"Spoiler\" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing.",

      "reviewBody": "An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I\u0027ve met, you\u0027ve met and we\u0027ve all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved in\n\nare most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of \"Human Traffic\" and the somber tone of \"My name is Joe\" and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of \"Perfect day\" and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise.

      "reviewBody": "I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn\u0027t seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe\u0027s old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.\n\nThe acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis\u0027 depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment\u0027s loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I\u0027ve ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.\n\nThe plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.",

      "name": "\"The Thing\" is John Carpenter\u0027s masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!",
      "reviewBody": "A classic film. John Carpenter\u0027s \"The Thing\" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?\n\nSeriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. \n\nIn my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I\u0027ll put any of \"The Thing\u0027s\" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven\u0027t seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see \"The Thing\" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who\u0027s your friend? Who\u0027s the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you\u0027ve never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?\n\n\"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.\" \n\nJohn Carpenter\u0027s The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero\u0027s Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.\n\nThe basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell\u0027s outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.\n\nIt is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80\u0027s ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! \u0027The Thing\u0027 is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell\u0027s characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt\u0027s best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

      "name": "Awesome film - shame about the trailer",
      "reviewBody": "Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack\u0027s 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within \u0027Room\u0027 - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in \u0027TV land\u0027 and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? \n\nAnd that\u0027s where I\u0027ll leave this synopsis, since (if you\u0027ve been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.\n\nThis is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny \"Frank\" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the \u0027evil kidnapper\u0027, is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.\n\nThe film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that \"Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives\".\n\nThe acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn\u0027t great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won\u0027t give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year\u0027s weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.\n\nSupporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy\u0027s mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the \"Bourne\" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.\n\nAt 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true \u0027teaser trailer\u0027 this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and \u0027given a good talking to\u0027 for this travesty. It\u0027s like putting all of the twists in films like \"The Crying Game\", \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Gone Girl\" in their respective trailers. I\u0027ve gone so far as to create my own One Mann\u0027s Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.\n\nA leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of \"Die Hard\" or \"Fast and Furious\" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.\n\nPlease visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.",

      "reviewBody": "Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind, I was well acquainted with Max Steiner\u0027s theme. It opened WOR TV\u0027s Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties. When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGM\u0027s re-releases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar Movie.\n\nMillion Dollar Movie is gone now, but Gone With the Wind, book and film, remain eternal. In these days Margaret Mitchell\u0027s southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher, let alone selling film rights to the story. But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyone\u0027s mind who reads the novel or sees the film. And that\u0027s just about the same because I can\u0027t think of another film that remained so faithful to the text.\n\nIt is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler. As the sober and ever realistic, but charming Rhett, Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen. However in the last half hour of the film when he\u0027s hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness, Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently. \n\nIf Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett, nobody knew who would be Scarlett. The search for Scarlett O\u0027Hara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part. Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first. While it was being down, David O. Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress, at least in the USA, Vivien Leigh.\n\nIt was a stroke of casting genius. Vivien Leigh\u0027s screen output is pretty small, she was primarily a stage actress. Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butler\u0027s. The story is her story, how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living she\u0027s become accustomed to from the pre-Civil War era. In the process she helps all those around her economically, but loses all their previous affection. \n\nI\u0027ve always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh, he\u0027ll be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him, she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing. He\u0027s fascinated by her, but because of that he\u0027s on to all her ploys.\n\nLeslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads. His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest. Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and you\u0027ve Ashley. He\u0027s stronger than he realizes though, he\u0027s the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runner.\n\nI\u0027ve always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton. Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett, decided to go after Melanie. \n\nIt\u0027s a deceptive part, superficially it\u0027s a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers. Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett, an incredibly kind and decent soul who can\u0027t see bad in anyone. One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling, the most prominent madam in Atlanta. The other women of society snub her, but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause. It\u0027s not about politics or slavery for Melanie, her husband is at war and his cause is her\u0027s.\n\nAnd DeHavilland\u0027s death scene would move the Medusa to tears. It\u0027s a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character. She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category, but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett\u0027s mammy.\n\nHattie\u0027s a shrewd judge of character, she\u0027s a slave, but she\u0027s also a family confidante of the O\u0027Haras. As Gable says, she\u0027s one of the few people he knows whose respect he wants.\n\nOf course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view. Growing up in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind. It\u0027s about what the white civilian population endured during the war and Reconstruction.\n\nDavid O. Selznick got a bit of irony in there though. Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing \u0027Let My People Go.\u0027 And that\u0027s just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to do.\n\nGone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for 1939 that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O. Selznick. Of course it was the Best Picture of 1939 and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress Awards.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer kept itself in the black for years by simply re-releasing Gone With the Wind. Unlike any other classic film, it won new generations of fans with theatrical re-release. Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this 67 year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write this.\n\nAnd I think Gone With the Wind, the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, and Melanie and the world they knew, will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now.",

I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it\u0027s premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, \"That\u0027s what I want to do.\" Sure the characters aren\u0027t deep and the dialogue isn\u0027t great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.",

All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.\" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul \n\nScott brought out the best qualities in his performers He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they\u0027ve rarely topped You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it\u0027s so rich and it\u0027s painful I mean it\u0027s a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately \n\nThe overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there\u0027s such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by You have a sense of layers in that society That is one of those things that you see again and again The city landscape with the big billboards à la Kyoto or Tokyo Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you\u0027re right in \"Blade Runner\" country \n\n\"Blade Runner,\" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience It\u0027s the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is The images and the sound and the music, it\u0027s pure cinema Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia The intensity of his perfectionism on \"Blade Runner\" made the movie This is a master at his best",

      "reviewBody": "I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular. Unlike some of today\u0027s grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography. Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson. The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito\u0027s hut is remarkable. Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men. Saito can\u0027t understand Nicholson\u0027s acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy. The film\u0027s plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined. Shears\u0027 return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge. In the film\u0027s final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean. One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.",

This picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is one of Bergman\u0027s most optimistic, profound, and warm films.\n\n\"Wild Strawberries\" provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life\u0027s disappointment, regrets, and losses. The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.\n\nSparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman\u0027s regulars  Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of \"Wild Strawberries\" which also include Bergman\u0027s writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It\u0027s a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.\n\n I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That\u0027s usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I\u0027m allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they\u0027re not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that\u0027s important for a good comedy. And it\u0027s hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She\u0027s an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she\u0027s doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. \n\nMovies like this aren\u0027t just being made for children exclusive... They\u0027re good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you\u0027re 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",

      "reviewBody": "Even today in Vienna, one can take the \"Third Man Tour\" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn\u0027t go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.\n\nWestern novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry\u0027s body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.\n\nHe then meets Harry\u0027s girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it\u0027s better that he\u0027s dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.\n\nOne of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there\u0027s some brilliant dialogue, particularly the \"cuckoo clock\" speech made by Orson Welles.\n\nThe cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.\n\nOne feels Lime\u0027s presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.\n\nThough none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.\n\nThere was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero. \n\nHe\u0027s no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen.",

      "name": "A classic for all the right reasons",
      "reviewBody": "Watching On The Waterfront nowadays, two scenes stand out head and shoulders above the rest. First is the impassioned speech by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to the gathered dock workers in the hull of a ship where he tries to rally them against the mobsters running their lives. Second is the confrontation between Terry and Charlie Malloy (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger) in the back of a taxi which ends in one brother pointing a gun at the other and Brando\u0027s now legendary \"contender speech.\" Both of them are sequences where the characters do nothing but talk but each is a fine example of what makes On The Waterfront the undeniable classic it is; acting, scripting, cinematography, music, everything fits into one cohesive whole and the end result is a welcome addition to any film collection.\n\nThe story here concerns Terry Malloy, a New York shipyard worker who finds his conscience bothering him when one of his friends is murdered. Terry at first is a tough guy with a grim outlook (\"you know my philosophy on life, give it to \u0027em before they give to you\") who despite his inner turmoil refuses to confess anything to the Police as it would make him a \"rat.\" However, the arrival of Malden\u0027s headstrong Preacher and the victim\u0027s innocent sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint in her debut appearance) throws his deaf and dumb world into chaos. Soon, Terry finds himself falling for Edie and the Preacher\u0027s words hit home, leaving the angry young dockworker to question what\u0027s really right. The mob meanwhile aren\u0027t too happy about Terry\u0027s UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP and begin to pile on the pressure, especially his older brother Charlie who\u0027s torn between loyalty to his boss and looking out for his younger sibling. Before anyone can put a lid on things, the dockyard becomes a very tense place to be.\n\nBrando of course puts his heart and soul into his performance. Terry by his very nature isn\u0027t one to carry his heart on his sleeve and so the great Method Actor is left to convey his turmoil through body language alone. It is a testament to how good he is that you can tell exactly what Terry is feeling even though he hardly ever expresses it verbally. Instead his shoulders hunch with resigned indignation and his eyes spark with anger, Brando playing the part so well he more or less disappears into the character completely. While he may have taken a lot of the credit however, he is far from the only strong presence in the film as Karl Malden\u0027s rock hard Preacher is just as compelling, his depiction of the dignified man of Christ who isn\u0027t afraid to drink beer and smoke cigarettes with the Wharf rats being a refreshingly positive portrayal of a Catholic leader. Eva Marie Saint meanwhile puts in a convincing portrayal of Edie, but she is hamstrung a little by some old fashioned writing. Her pursuit of her brother\u0027s murderers give her some powerful moments but there are a couple of instances where it becomes all too clear that the part was written by a man. However, she still gives us one of the most touching moments in the film, a confrontation with Terry where most of their chat is disrupted by a tug horn that is achingly sad despite the absence of dialogue.\n\nActing is only one half of the equation of course and needless to say, the story remains constantly gripping. The murder that opens the film leaves an instant grip on the viewer\u0027s attention and as Terry spirals further into an intricate web of half truths, things get incredibly dark. The New York tenement blocks that tower over the proceedings provide an imposing sense of claustrophobia while the rooftops are a smoke laden jungle of chimney stacks and TV aerials. However, if you look closely it becomes apparent that the crew still had some fun with the material and there is some subtle humour to be had - a wedding party degenerating into a brawl and a bar full of panicked customers emptying into the streets followed by a shot of one isolated individual desperately jumping into the bathroom.\n\nAll in all therefore, On The Waterfront is a film that is thoroughly deserving of its reputation. Brando excels in his role and heads up a highly talented cast giving it their all. Most of all though, it\u0027s an engaging and captivating story of urban paranoia, filled with tough guys spitting out slang in barking New York accents. Think you\u0027re a big shot, do ya? Huh? Well do us all a favour and check this one out. Ah enough a youse guys, ged outta here.",

      "reviewBody": "\"What\u0027d this guy look like anyway?\" \"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin\u0027.\" \"Uh-huh. In what way?\" \"Just a general way.\" In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen\u0027s finest film. Of course you can draw comparisons to others they\u0027ve made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers\u0027 takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard\u0027s stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson\u0027s confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn\u0027t imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, \"He\u0027s fleeing the interview!\" Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There\u0027s comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi\u0027s violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry\u0027s haplessly kidnapped wife. If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you\u0027ll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure it\u0027s outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino\u0027s movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker? Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the \u002760s and \u002770s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It\u0027s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.\u0027 iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie\u0027 blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride\u0027s gory face as she\u0027s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride \u0027Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai\u0027 - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\n\nThis film\u0027s a sampling of the Tarantino \u0027fury,\u0027 short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It\u0027s almost as if I\u0027m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that\u0027s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It\u0027s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite \u0027old-school\u0027 filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there\u0027s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\n\n Even at \u0027The House Of Blue Leaves\u0027, we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill\u0027s DVAS members.\u0027 My adrenaline\u0027s still flowing as I\u0027m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by. The film\u0027s surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today\u0027s society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium. Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living? Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the \"real world\" in the credits, but in \"Christof\u0027s World.\" His high-profile media-driven life is no different from Truman\u0027s!",

      "reviewBody": "If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood\u0027s Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood\u0027s long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.\n\nYou know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can\u0027t bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood\u0027s direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.\n\nFollowing the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt\u0027s less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to \u0027keep an eye on him\u0027, but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family\u0027s youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt\u0027s prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.\n\nAll of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt\u0027s life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.\n\nWith a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.",

It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.\n\nHowever who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.\n\nOzu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it.\n\nImpressing also to see how close the everyday life of Japan in the mid 50s is to the western way of life.",

The vets who don\u0027t like it have it wrong, as do the Vietnamese who found it racist. It could be any war, with any combatants. But because the (primary) victims here are recognizable American archetypes, Americans will feel this in their gut more than any other war film I know of. This is one of the very few post-war Hollywood films that shows a sincere reverence for the lives of small town Americans.\n\nAfter seeing it in a very high quality theater on its initial release, I walked out thinking it was easily one of the best movies I had ever seen - and that I never wanted to see it again. But I looked at it today on cable and found that not much had changed about it, or me. I don\u0027t want to see it again...but I want you to see it.\n\nEven now, the Russian Roulette scene (in context, people: watch all that comes before it first) is the single most intense sequence I\u0027ve seen; it makes the end of \"Reservoir Dogs\" seem like a cartoon. Best Walken performance, period. Meryl Streep glows, DeNiro has seldom been more affecting. A unique classic...it is not surprising that Cimino didn\u0027t have another movie in him after something this wrenching.",

Maybe they should\u0027ve made a shorter movie, and cut some sequences out (the scenes of the interrogations to the three different suspects are a little bit reiterative), and the ending seems a little forced to me. Anyway, Memories Of Murder is much more effective and serious than the most of nowadays\u0027 Hollywood detective films.\n\nMy rate: 7.5/10",

Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking \"What\u0027s so wild about it? It is just lame\" and by the end of the intro I was like \"Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!\"\n\nAnd it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar to Russia.

The script never loosens its grip on the nerves. The potential challenges of losing the heart of a short film while making it into a feature is always present but the makers of Andhadhun really succeeded in laying the foundation for future talents. Coming back to the film, it is chaotic, hilarious n very ntertaining. It is well paced and has funny situations as well as a black sense of humor. Watch out for that shady hospital scene man. The movie is well cast, with amusing performances by Ayushman n Tabu. The director did a superb job. Raghavan was definitely having a little fun after the dark thriller Badlapur.",

      "reviewBody": "This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special. Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn\u0027t rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids\u0027 interest. It just tells a story.\n\nThe story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he\u0027ll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.\n\nThis is, in a way, Jesper\u0027s coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus\u0027 growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.\n\nApart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus\u0027 technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.\n\nKlaus isn\u0027t dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people. In Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.\n\nThe only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and Márgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can\u0027t really hold this against Klaus.\n\nSo, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks.",

      "reviewBody": "Acting is one of the most key elements to success or failure of a film. Some film types can survive without superb acting. These motion pictures can entertain the viewer with special effects or intense action scenes. A film based on heavy dialog and back-story can not survive with out excellent actors. One such movie that meets the dialog-based criterion is The Big Lebowski. The film follows Jeff \u0027The Dude\u0027 Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) and his two close friends through a not so normal chain of events. The story is augmented by the supporting characters Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Written by Joel and Ethan Coen, the creative forces behind Fargo, the intriguing story succeeds because of the actors\u0027 impeccable skill. \n\nAs with many other films by the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski is an odd array of out of the ordinary characters slapped right in the middle of an improbable situation. The Dude is an unlikely hero living in the city of Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a botched kidnapping. This is not the average kidnapper comedy that has been seen a thousand times before. The Coen brothers take a fresh look at an old tired subject. The story they have created is intriguing and entertaining, but the true entertainment comes from the unique characters. Walter, played by John Goodman, is a Vietnam veteran who seems to have some parts of post traumatic stress syndrome. Donny, another one of The Dude\u0027s close friends, is a quiet unassuming character who often interjects into conversation, but no one pays close attention to what he says.\n\nAs well as these characters are written, they would not be as effective had they been played by other actors. This effectiveness of acting can be seen in the opening scene at the bowling alley where the supporting characters are first introduced. This scene is comprised of Donny, Walter, and The Dude sitting at their lane in the bowling alley discussing the attack on The Dude by some hired thugs (7min 25 sec). The Dude is approaching the situation in his usual lackadaisical way. Jeff Bridges conveys The Dude\u0027s overall demeanor in his laid back, sauntering, walk. Although being laid back, Bridges is direct in his speaking showing that The Dude is not the average confused old stoner. Bridges facial expressions during this scene show The Dude is distressed about the loss of his rug which \u0027tied the room together.\u0027\n\nDonny seems to be an outside observer in this scene and throughout much of the film. Buscemi conveys his character\u0027s attention during discussion by following the flow of the conversation with his head. He looks from The Dude to Walter and from Walter to The Dude depending on who is talking. He may seem to be paying attention, but his asking of simple questions dispels this assumption. Another technique Buscemi uses is while he is observing the conversation he furrows his brow as if in deep thought and contemplation. This look of concentration is juxtaposed with the look of confused happiness, an empty smile, Buscemi uses when Donny makes a point in the conversation. These techniques which are introduced by Bridges and Buscemi early in the film are used throughout the entire picture. \n\nAlthough Bridges and Buscemi do an excellent job of introducing their characters traits to the viewer, Goodman superbly shows his character\u0027s inner traits. Throughout the conversation it is apparent due to dialog that Walter is becoming upset. Goodman conveys this anger with facial expressions and body movement. In the early part of the conversation Goodman puts on a stone face to show that Walter is firmly set in his position. The Dude begins to agitate Walter as the conversation continues. Goodman shows this agitation by furrowing his brow, leaning forward while talking, and turning progressively redder. As Goodman continues, his speaking becomes more staccato and flustered. When The Dude refers to one of the attackers as \u0027the china man,\u0027 Walter continues on his tirade momentarily then quietly addresses the non politically correct nature of The Dude\u0027s comment. Changing from this aggravated manner of speaking to a more politically correct and lower tone shows that Walter has some sudden mood swings and a short fuse, as he returns to his tirade quickly. \n\nThis scene exemplifies the acting skills of John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi. The characters in this story have been given interesting and entertaining dialog by the writers, but it is up to the actors to make the characters exude a certain feeling or trait. In each of their roles the three main actors add a level of feeling to the characters that is lacking from many of the offerings of the dark comedy genre. Goodman\u0027s portrayal of Walter as the \u0027know it all\u0027 with a short fuse is downright hilarious. Jeff Bridges steps out of his usually serious persona to portray a character as laid back as they come, \u0027quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county.\u0027 Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as ever. His depiction of Donny, the character to rarely speak, adds depth to an otherwise bland side character. After viewing this film one can see why actors who can actually practice their craft are worth their weight in gold.",

I am currently working on the IMDb Top 250 list and Mary and Max just entered the IMDb top 250, so I took a look at it.\n\nI watched it with a small screen on my computer while chatting with someone on Facebook. But then I logged out because I got hooked by the fantastic but sad narration mixed with humor by Barry Humphries, so I watched it with a big screen. Thank God that I did that, because this is an unforgettable and heartbreaking cinematic experience! It got fantastic narration and dialogue that will make you laugh and cry!\n\nPS.There are many scenes that will choke you up, so bring some tissues.\n\nPSS.Don\u0027t watch this movie with your kids!\n\nI hope this review was useful!",

      "reviewBody": "Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film. Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it. Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in. Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it. This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best. Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn\u0027t want to grow up. He has had so many troubles at home his father\n\nGiuseppe played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.\n\nFrom there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other\u0027s feeling and face up to where they stand in the world. Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad. What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it\u0027s more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.\n\nOne film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.",

      "reviewBody": "Two movies for the price of one. \n\nThat\u0027s a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard \"did he or didn\u0027t he\" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you\u0027re watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you\u0027ve ever seen. \n\nDespite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck\u0027s Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike\u0027s Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.\n\nDavid Fincher\u0027s direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn\u0027t need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.\n\nGone Girl is a movie unlike any that I\u0027ve ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",

I will be surprised if we don\u0027t see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss\u0027s act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it\u0027s place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",

His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author \u0026 F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson \u0026 countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience).",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\", they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It\u0027s not quite on the level of \"It\u0027s a Wonderful Life\", but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.\n\nStewart\u0027s performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.\n\nThe secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart\u0027s troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation.",

From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique, THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy. Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman, Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story. The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier, but as a train engineer. However, his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform. After the war has started, the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keaton\u0027s train, and so begins the greatest (and funniest) chase ever filmed. For the next 75 minutes, the viewer is in Keaton\u0027s world. His gags, routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmed.\n\n-Matt, age 16",

      "reviewBody": "From its opening, seemingly random B\u0026W images, Ingmar Bergman\u0027s \"Persona\" screams intellectualism. The film is cold, clinical, and abstract. It induces deep, philosophical questions that lack answers, or questions that provide for a multiplicity of emotionally unsatisfying answers.\n\nAbout eight minutes into the film, the story begins. In a hospital, young Nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is assigned to care for Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), an actress who, for no apparent reason, has ceased speaking. Concluding that there is nothing physically or mentally wrong with Elisabeth, the hospital exports her to a seaside cottage, where she is to be cared for by Nurse Alma. Most of the rest of the film is set at the cottage, where the two women get to know each other. But throughout, Elisabeth does not speak. She communicates only with facial expressions and body gestures.\n\nFor all of Elisabeth\u0027s silence, the film\u0027s script is remarkably talky. Nurse Alma talks in long monologues: asking, probing, recalling. She tries to build a relationship with Elisabeth, by vocalizing her own memories and emotional pains in life. Certainly, the film\u0027s curious narrative has a lot to \"say\" about the art, or rather the artificiality, of human communication.\n\nThe best element of the film is the artistic, B\u0026W cinematography by Sven Nykvist. Lighting trends toward high contrast, with stark boundaries between light and darkness, a feature that contributes to the film\u0027s cold, intellectual tone. There are lots of close-up shots, even extreme close-ups, of the two women. The film\u0027s production design is ascetic, unadorned, austere. And this, too, enhances the analytic, abstract feel of the film.\n\nBergman conceived \"Persona\" while he was confined to a hospital. And I am inclined to think that the film is a cinematic expression of his own inward psychological struggles during that period of his life.\n\nIn other words, \"Persona\" communicates to us as much about Bergman\u0027s mindset, and his ideas of suffering and reality, as it does about any deep, universal questions in a post-modern world, although to some extent, the two dimensions intersect and overlap. Bergman is telling us that, ultimately, the film is not real. It is \"nothing\". It is an artificial human construct. That is, it is art, a perception that approximates, but does not replace, what we experience as reality.",

That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.\n\nI didn\u0027t read the book, so I don\u0027t know the story, witch might have suffered, as stories usually do from books to picture, but I think a writer couldn\u0027t hope for a better image, better portraits of characters, especially the black dragon who one definitely falls in love with - the mimic and the gestures and the face expressions, so complex and real. \n\nI agree it\u0027s not the kind of movie that makes you keep thinking too much once it\u0027s finished bot it\u0027s not meant to be. It\u0027s just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I\u0027m 22). The film wasn\u0027t too long, it didn\u0027t have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.\n\nI don\u0027t know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again. \n\nGreat special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon.",

Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.\n\nThe first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster\u0027s father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son\u0027s films.\n\nThere\u0027s a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.\n\nIt is in Junior\u0027s other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.\n\nSherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.\n\nJustly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton\u0027s cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today.",

      "name": "A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity",
      "reviewBody": "Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family\u0027s two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven\u0027t gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he\u0027s willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. \n\nA spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn\u0027t feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There\u0027s one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters\u0027 actions and the characters themselves, and there\u0027s the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can\u0027t possibly (always) be the \"goody-two-shoes\" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie\u0027s events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. \n\nAnd holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there\u0027s Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. \n\nSpeaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you\u0027ve left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that\u0027s transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year\u0027s Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. \n\nFurthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you\u0027re of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and \"fun,\" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year\u0027s features that I\u0027ll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let\u0027s hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",

      "reviewBody": "Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)\n\nOne of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won\u0027t respond to it because it\u0027s too \"difficult\" to sit through. Let\u0027s define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I\u0027d argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of \"too difficult\" around.\n\nI\u0027ve watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I\u0027ve seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg\u0027s \"Schindler\u0027s List\" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass\u0027 \"United 93\", which is almost an emotional biopic of America\u0027s darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson\u0027s \"The Passion of the Christ\", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, \"it\u0027s too hard watch.\" Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone\u0027s ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can\u0027t answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn\u0027t just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.\n\nNow when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.\n\nI have long admired the talent that\u0027s been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I\u0027ve known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.\n\nAs Edwin Epps, Solomon\u0027s last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the \"Amon Goeth\" of our tale, he is exactly what you\u0027d expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He\u0027s vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.\n\nMark my words; Lupita Nyong\u0027o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful \"Patsey\" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You\u0027re watching the birth of a star.\n\nHans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP\u0027s in the business. Especially following his work in \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.\n\nOscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar\u0027s in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There\u0027s also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master\u0027s house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven\u0027t seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this \"difficult\" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there\u0027s no reason it can\u0027t top the night. I\u0027m very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in \"12 Years a Slave?\" I remain hopeful.",

      "reviewBody": "Now that it has become sort of fashionable to speak or write badly about the films of the 60s and 70s, saying that people stopped going to the movie theatres during that fruitful period (which is not true), we must -more than ever-rate a flick as \"Cool Hand Luke\" as it really deserves. The rebel spirit of the lead character (played to perfection by the excellent Paul Newman) against that brutal and -most of the times- unfair \"establishment\" represented by the prison guards is a subject that remains as topical as ever. If this picture had been made today, it could also probably be good, but it would undoubtedly be much more unpleasant and filled with four-letter words. Besides, who could match the performances of Newman, George Kennedy (the deservedly Oscar-winner who has kept on making a brilliant career -do you remember him as \"The Blue Knight\"?), Strother Martin, J.D.Cannon, etc.? Jo Van Fleet´s character as Luke´s mother seems a sort of slightly-aged version of her role as James Dean´s mum in \"East Of Eden\", and it is really worthwhile. The scene of the hard-boiled eggs is a classic and a gem, but my favourite scene in the movie is that of the car-washing girl so wonderfully played by Joy Harmon (who is really a Joy for any man´s eyes); that character truly says a lot of things without speaking -her gorgeous body speaks for her! I must say that it´s not only one of the sexiest scenes I´ve ever seen in a film but also a very significative one: there is an enormous contrast between the image of the lass moving and shaking in complete and absolute freedom (even in her way of dressing) and the imprisoned men-at-work who watch her as something extremely desirable but, alas, completely out of reach. (The viewer can really feel like a prisoner too!). All in all, this is a fine film of the 60s, but also of the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 21st century and whatever God wants it to come.",

      "reviewBody": "Mad Max Fury Road follows a determined man named Max Rockatansky to wander the post-apocalyptic wasteland alone, Max surely joins Furiosa, a fugitive imperator, and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord and are trying to get to a safe haven. I really can\u0027t describe how in awe I was with this film, I was extremely impressed. The stunts, the makeup, the action \u0026 the camera shots were all so dead-on and did not fail to impress. One thing that kinda upsets me is that when the film ended and everyone was walking out, I overheard things like \"that was garbage\" or \"what a piece of sh*t film\", that really angered me a little because I know that a lot was put into this film and they think they can do better? Unbelievable. Anyway, this didn\u0027t dissatisfy me at all and let\u0027s talk about why it did! Even though this is supposed to be a action film, they added some slow moments just to emphasize more character and fondness toward each person which was fantastic. George Miller did such a satisfactory job with that. The action, don\u0027t let me forget about the action, this is what made the film so much more engaging to watch and I mean that with each insane character given, it made the action more fun and insane to watch. The score was unbelievable, I\u0027ll just leave it at that because you know, it was! Tom Hardy had some pretty big shoes to fill but yet he knocked it right out of the park with given so little dialogue to say, he still manages to be a complete badass. Same goes for Charlize Theron, she played such a cool character with some great sympathy for herself and the people shes protecting and yet she does have some sweet skills and the prosthetic arm was a nice touch. Also for Nicholas Hoult, he plays such a basket case that will do anything to impress Immortan Joe and yet, he starts to become a very likable character. I swear, the makeup in this was was so spot-on that I really believed that these were actually mental people and also I thought that half of the people in this looked like albinos which added more effect to the mental aspect of them. The camera angles in this were flawless it was unbelievable even with so much going on at the same time, George really managed to get a lot of what we had to see, wait, I mean we needed to see! Hugh Keays- Byrne did such a menacing job as Immortan Joe, he played the role as such a character that doesn\u0027t let anything get in his way and always gets what he wants but yet so insane. Yes, there was a lot of disturbing images in this that can probably make you gag a little, it\u0027s truly a sight for sore eyes of what I had to see in this but hey, we\u0027re talking about a Mad Max film here. The costume design was very odd as well which looked so deserted and worn that them fit so well each character. My favorite part of the film would have to be the beginning scene, George proved he really knows how to work a camera and really made the atmosphere of the situation Max was faced with, more exciting and intoxicating! Overall, I might of exaggerated in this review but who cares, it was worth it and I mean\u0027t every word of it and this film might possibly be a modern day masterpiece! With a 2 hour runtime, this film really seems to go by fast but yet who\u0027s worried about that when you\u0027re distracted by such insanity. Please guys, go see this action packed, pulse pounding \u0026 off the wall thrill ride to Fury Road with the Mad Man himself!",

      "reviewBody": "Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, \u0027Les Diaboliques\u0027 and \u0027The Wages Of Fear\u0027, both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension. Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. \u0027The Wages Of Fear\u0027 could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that\u0027s what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make \u0027Wages Of Fear\u0027 a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don\u0027t come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece.",

It\u0027s obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.\n\nIt couldn\u0027t be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don\u0027t want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can\u0027t even tell they\u0027re acting. It feels like you\u0027re watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time. I could write 20 more pages about it\u0027s brilliance, but I\u0027ll stop now to keep me from rating. I just have to say that it\u0027s so rare to find a film as incredibly flawless as this.",

Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a \"bad kid.\" And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.\n\nTo me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don\u0027t know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.\n\nThis film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.",

      "reviewBody": "In fact it\u0027s one of Kubrick\u0027s most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of \"Dr. Strangelove\" (and it\u0027s unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s). English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into \"the trap of the picturesque\", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world. Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don\u0027t have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.\n\nTHIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen. Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it\u0027s cut altogether - you won\u0027t catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in. The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it\u0027s about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don\u0027t. (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.) And as always, Kubrick\u0027s musical sense is unerring. My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles. I was more or less right. But then I noticed Schubert\u0027s name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I\u0027d been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.\n\nIt\u0027s a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this. Look at the ones he\u0027s responsible for: \"Spartacus\" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) \"2001\" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and \"Barry Lyndon\". The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",

      "reviewBody": "I don\u0027t know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through \"Pale Rider\" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn\u0027t lie to them, doesn\u0027t kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even \"Boys don\u0027t Cry\" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That\u0027s a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",

      "name": "A Realistic Vietnam film Oliver\u0027s Stone\u0027s masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone\u0027s Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. \n\nThose of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what\u0027s left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. \n\nIn Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man\u0027s highest value... life.\n\nChris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn\u0027t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the \"enemy\" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it\u0027s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.\n\nThe platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man\u0027s wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man\u0027s young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. \n\nElias doesn\u0027t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.\n\nPlatoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn\u0027t any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.\n\nThe best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80\u0027s, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don\u0027t watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.\n\nThe battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10",

I\u0027ve never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.\n\nI read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can\u0027t remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn\u0027t only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is \u0027God\u0027 in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it\u0027s true.\n\nIt\u0027s a must watch movie.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw \u0027Ben Hur\u0027 I was 8 years old and hadn\u0027t seen many films, since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).\n\nThe experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. \n\nDespite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur\u0027s dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it\u0027s Ben Hur. And even now, after I\u0027ve seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don\u0027t mean that in a religious sense).\n\nMy verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many \"sandal and sword\" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.\n\nPure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",

      "name": "Thrilling character study",
      "reviewBody": "As Asif Kapadia\u0027s gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is frightfully dull (although I\u0027m sure plenty will disagree with that), but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented these men were at driving these \"coffins on wheels\", every race could spell out death. Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired, dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent. His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical, and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night type, \u0027rat-faced\u0027 and cold. In every sense, he\u0027s the perfect villain. But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions of these two characters. There\u0027s little fun to be had with Lauda, but played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed, but it\u0027s at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976 Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames, and leads to Lauda\u0027s defiant early return to the driver\u0027s seat, scarred and bandaged. Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful, critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70\u0027s initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But he doesn\u0027t neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing personalities coming together on the world stage. Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from the next and literally putting us in the driver\u0027s seat with the use of digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic territory with the introduction of the \u0027wives\u0027 (played by Oivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as an insight into Hunt and Lauda\u0027s personalities. Hemsworth is very good in his first \u0027proper\u0027 post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it\u0027s a crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of sport.",

      "reviewBody": "I admit I was taken aback with this one. I hadn\u0027t planned on watching as Wolverine films tend to be a bore to me. Not long into it, I was sure I had missed a previous film, one that would explain for example how Xavier ended up broken and hidden away, how Wolverine has washed up as an alcoholic limo driver.\n\nBut no this is it apparently, and this is the thing.\n\nWe can be lowered late at night in the middle of a world that has long now been spun in motion. We can discover as we go. We can catch glimpses of a larger world as we move through it. We don\u0027t need to be racing to save the world, making it out of this room alive is enough, wondering and having no idea where to turn to next are fine.\n\nNone of it is novel, in fact all of them mainstays of 80s film, from Bladerunner to Terminator. But after a glut of samey, mechanized Marvel and X- men movies obsessed with \u0027universing\u0027 a greater story, this one feels welcome and fresh.\n\nAnother obvious influence here are western films and this probably sheds some light on Wolverine\u0027s popularity. So many of the other X-men have awesome abilities to alter the fabric of reality; Wolverine is just a gruff who kicks and punches his way through. It seems there\u0027s always going to be a hankering for the simple, uncomplicated guy.\n\nSo what more obvious choice than to cast him in the light of cowboy? It works but you\u0027ll note it\u0027s not any cowboy. They could have used Red River as template, or The Searchers. They used Shane. The flawed guy who risks all to ensure there are \u0027no more guns in the valley\u0027 but must ride off again at the end because his kind has no place in the world of loving farmsteads.\n\nIt\u0027s always indicative of a broader sensibility when I see this type being used, the resignation that someone has no place in a changing world and is better off being swept away with the old, this seen as \u0027honorable\u0027 and heroic.\n\nBut from the little girl (and her friends\u0027) point-of- view we have what? A fictional Eden they only knew as stories in a book but their desire for it has inspired an actual one.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Andrei Rublev\" is not merely my favourite all-time film; it transcends such pat, by-the-numbers praise. I have seen \"Andrei Rublev\" three times (twice on the big screen), at three very different points in my life. Each viewing, it has spoken eloquently and directly, has immersed and fascinated me. And has moved me with superlative skill and force. Other great movies have entertained me, inspired me, made me think; only \"Rublev\" has palpably altered my outlook on life.\n\nAndrei Rublev was a medieval Russian iconographer; the film chronicles his struggle to maintain faith and artistry in a world of immeasurable cruelty and suffering. Rather than give us a crackerjack plot line with all the proper scene climaxes \u0026 paradigm shifts, director Tarkovsky presents us with a world in which we must immerse ourselves; once we are inside, we are confronted with rigorous pain and profound triumph. The movie is divided into chapters; the final one, involving an orphaned bell-maker\u0027s son, is a stunning film-within-a-film that provides a microcosm of the whole movie. That section, if it stood alone, would be my all-time favourite film.\n\nBe warned: \"Andrei Rublev\" is SLOW. You have to slide into it; it\u0027s not a flick which dazzles, it is a world which beguiles, and which demands to be inhabited. Also, there are EXTREMELY difficult scenes to watch--torture and bloodshed abounds. Watching the Tartar attack on a Russian town is the most painful experience I\u0027ve ever had--not just in a cinema, but in life.\n\nFor those willing to make the gruelling trek, however, \"Andrei Rublev\" is an inspiring, life-affecting experience. Created under an oppressive Soviet regime (which banned the film for years, recognizing its symbolic commentary on 20th-century Soviet government), the film shows how life can be valuable and even joyful, no matter how much suffering stands in the way.\n\nEspecially recommended for Tarkovsky fans, Dostoevsky fans, fans of medieval art, and anyone grappling with questions about suffering and human expression.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw this a few months ago on the big screen, just after Nosferatu, another silent classic. Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.\n\nMy eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",

      "reviewBody": "Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I\u0027d be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.\n\nThe movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or \"Oh Captain, my Captain\", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.\n\nThere are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he\u0027s an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn\u0027t give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he\u0027s so embarrassed.\n\nPeter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie \"Master and Commander\" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.\n\nSome of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that \"he wanted to throw up at the end of the film\". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won\u0027t put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",

      "reviewBody": "Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre \u0026 unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It\u0027s more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.\n\nDeathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven\u0027t seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you\u0027ll be confused to death. Obvious isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.\n\nThe series doesn\u0027t only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It\u0027s a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince\u0027s Tale scene.\n\nNo need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.\n\nFor me it\u0027s really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I\u0027m not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you\u0027re a fan or not, you\u0027ll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.",

      "reviewBody": "The memorable story of young, troubled Antoine is worth seeing for a good number of reasons, probably most of all for the thoughtful direction by François Truffaut. It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine\u0027s life.\n\nAs Antoine, Jean-Pierre Léaud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine\u0027s character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.\n\nThe story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.",

      "reviewBody": "Film Review\n\nRang De Basanti\n\nIndia Awakens\n\nBy Nidhi Kathuria\n\nRating *****\n\n\u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word \u0027go\u0027, this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career\u0027s best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What \u0027Mangal Pandey\u0027 couldn\u0027t do for Aamir Khan, \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn\u0027t have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her \u0027pucca Punjaban\u0027 character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called \u0027Young Guns of India\u0027 based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of \u0027Mangal Pandey\u0027 completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that\u0027s what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours\u0027 souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.\n\nThe Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia\u0027s fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. \n\nRating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding",

I`m not talking about politics. maybe you haven`t lived violence as near as i have, but im gonna tell you something, that is the main reason i voted 9 this movie: Amores perros is not fiction. Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensive models that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes, we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we have houses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as you think. Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Yourè seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you",

Interesting characters. Action, adventure, and above all feeling, the mood just sucks me in and holds on till the very end and beyond. The music is epic, and the animation is top class. The setting is a futuristic kind of midevil inspired fantasy... if that says anything... but anyway it feels very real although fantastic and apeals to me. This movie is from the very heart of Hayao Miyazaki, the master of anime... Its so sad that the dubbed version was so butchered, it was the first version I saw(actualy the swedish dubbing of the american dubbing(sigh)) and I thaught it was great, but now that I have seen the original, a new door has opened and revealed a true masterpiece. I recomend this film to all and everyone. Average 10(10)",

The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.\n\nKeaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. \n\nJust brilliant.",

I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. \n\nThis movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.\n\nThematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.\n\nThe story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.\n\nThe music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.\n\nIt isn\u0027t a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock felt \u0027Rebecca\u0027, his first Hollywood film, was a compromise, but as a viewer I just can\u0027t fault it. It\u0027s a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It\u0027s also one of the most romantic movies I\u0027ve ever seen. I\u0027ve watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I\u0027m not much of an Olivier fan but he\u0027s superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter\u0027s new bride. I can\u0027t spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can\u0027t imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in \u0027Suspicion\u0027 with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but \u0027Rebecca\u0027 is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson (\u0027Laura\u0027) as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca\u0027s slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter\u0027s bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in \u0027Foreign Correspondent\u0027, and Bruce played Cary Grant\u0027s lovable pal \"Beaky\" in \u0027Suspicion\u0027. I sometimes think that Hitchcock\u0027s 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too \"old fashioned\", but for me movies like \u0027Suspicion\u0027, \u0027Saboteur\u0027, \u0027Lifeboat\u0027 and \u0027Spellbound\u0027 are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and \u0027Rebecca\u0027 is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch \u0027Rebecca\u0027!",

      "reviewBody": "It\u0027s hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle\u0027s and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone\u0027s vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.\n\nRocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn\u0027t like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn\u0027t so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It\u0027s about a guy, much like you or me, who\u0027s down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He\u0027s pushing 30, single and broke. I\u0027m sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. \n\nIt\u0027s hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he\u0027s talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It\u0027s a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone\u0027s face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn\u0027t in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it\u0027s empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he\u0027s wasting his life. It\u0027s more than beautiful or real.\n\nIt\u0027s safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God\u0027s help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I\u0027d want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn\u0027t care. Because, \"I\u0027m at least half a bum.\"",

The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.\n\nIt\u0027s a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children\u0027s screams into energy that is used for electrical power. It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children\u0027s bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.\n\nThere\u0027s a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures. One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team. Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.\n\nBut what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo\u0027s. It\u0027s wondrous and funny. In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.\n\nJohn Goodman is the voice of `Sulley\u0027 a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who\u0027s the star Monsters, Inc. employee. He\u0027s some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children. He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.\n\nSulley\u0027s best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who\u0027s a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye. His comedy is seen through out the movie. Mike is Sulley\u0027s driving force, acting as his agent. Mike\u0027s job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he\u0027s on top.\n\nMike\u0027s girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike\u0027s best interest at heart. Her job is to keep him out of trouble.\n\nI give Monsters, Inc. a ten. It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It makes for great family fun.",

      "reviewBody": "Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people\u0027 through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of Paris\n\nLa Haine (Hate\u0027) begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L\u0027Avenir c\u0027est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate\u0027s playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.\n\nThe quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz\u0027s script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us. Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood films\n\nLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the projects\u0027 in France, and all over the world. It doesn\u0027t offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .\n\nThe strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it\u0027s boring, and they despise the society that\u0027s created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film\u0027s other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.\n\nA criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don\u0027t help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.\n\nThis certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after  not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.",

      "reviewBody": "Consider this, \"It Happened One Night\" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930\u0027s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. \n\nThe main reason \"It Happened One Night\" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra\u0027s direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: \"That French broad likes money\" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.\n\nThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father\u0027s private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.\n\nWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: \"Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It\u0027s also clever, funny and a bit risqué (for 1934)\" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion\u0027s opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.\n\nAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I\u0027m only a child.",

      "reviewBody": "In Hong Kong, 1962, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. \u0027In the Mood for Love\u0027 is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \u0027Amor À Flor da Pele\u0027 (\u0027Love on the Surface of the Skin\u0027)",

The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.\n\nSiddiqui\u0027s role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.\n\nApart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.\n\nThe camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb. \n\nAnurag Kashyap is India\u0027s answer to Quentin Terentino. Gangs of Waseypur is already a Cult.",

That first thing said, i have to recognize that i\u0027m really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with \"Before Sunset\" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It\u0027s just a construction. It\u0027s just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn\u0027t felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It\u0027s the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.\n\nSo, i really recommend it, even if you didn\u0027t saw the first one.",

With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.\n\nCary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.\n\nThe plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases- many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie. If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.\n\nI have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my \u0027sick day\u0027 movie because it is such a joy.",

      "reviewBody": "I just got back from a special-screening of \"The Help\" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.\n\nNow, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as \u0027Skeeter\u0027? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won\u0027t go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.\n\nCasting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that \"the blacks had to be \u0027saved\u0027 by the whites\" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real \"heroes\" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).\n\nI can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what \"The Help\" strides and aims for, without making it \"cheesy\". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks\u0027 side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less \"mean\" or \"degrading\" to any sides.\n\nThere are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn\u0027t have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn\u0027t even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.\n\nAll in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nMovie rating: 9/10",

What a discovery!\n\nWith its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina, a composer, and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both, the story may have elements of a soap opera, but it\u0027s a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter, I\u0027m sure, is the film\u0027s depiction of the artists\u0027 creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere, but I haven\u0027t seen it. Besides that, it\u0027s beautifully directed, beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning, and I\u0027m not just using that word as a cliche.\n\nAnton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov, leader of the ballet troupe. There are many real-life artists from the ballet world in the film, including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.\n\nDon\u0027t be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film; it\u0027s high quality AND accessible. Anyone who enjoys art (especially ballet), romance or just plain good moviemaking owes it to themselves to see it.",

      "reviewBody": "It might seem odd to call this an \"American\" film, as its director, Wim Wenders is a German film director, who , unlike his predecessors, Lang, Murnau, Pabst, Von Sternberg , and Billy Wilder, has chosen to remain aloof from the Hollywood film industry. But Paris Texas is as much an American film as Tocquevillle\u0027s \"Democracy in America\" is an American book. Sometimes it takes a foreigner ( In Wim Wenders\u0027 case, a foriegner who loves American music, American movies and American literature.) to look into the American soul. In this case,it helps that he is working with a great-and misunderstood- American writer, Sam Shephard, and a great-and under appreciated- American actor, Harry Dean Stanton. I can not begin to convey who poetic, how haunting, and how beautiful this film is, and how artfully it probes the American heart. The scene where Stanton confronts his wife, and tells what he did and why he did it, must rank among the supreme scenes, not just of film, but of human life. It echoed the great scenes of our literature, such as Ulysses meeting with Penelope, and the return of the prodigal son. In short, the only film which goes beyond it in the eighties is Raging Bull, and that is largely because of the volcanic power of Scorsese, that most self-crucifying of auteurs. in short, I would go so far as to say that Paris Texas is more than a \"ten\u0027...Like Citizen Kane, like 2001, like Andrei Roublev, like Raging Bull , like the Searchers, like Pickpocket, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai and Ordet,it is an ELEVEN. Sublime AND beautiful.",

      "reviewBody": "Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold? For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man. His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine. It\u0027s almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge. People didn\u0027t realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film. And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).\n\nAs we all know what the story is, I\u0027ll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it. First I have to mention Michael Biehn. He has the real starring role. He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience. He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why. It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right. But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him. Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies \" Terminator\u0027s don\u0027t feel pain. I do. Don\u0027t do that again. \" That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing. Biehn is perfect for the role.\n\nThis is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films. And they are so passionate with what they have to say. I like it when a film has something to say. I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.\n\nFinally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film. One, this is the first film where \"I\u0027ll be back\" was spoken. Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular. Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it. And he adds spark to any film that he\u0027s in. Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.\n\nA great film.",

      "name": "Drishyam: A Perfect movie for ending my tiring Thursday",
      "reviewBody": "Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.\n\nMy special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move \"Visuals Can Be Deceptive\" The Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu\u0027s never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously. Overall, Its 100% worth a watch on this weekend, so go ahead book your tickets and go for it, I am sure you wont be disappointed, specially people who like Ajay Devgn on screen should go for this movie for sure.",

It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.\n\nButch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law. The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do. The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them. There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.\n\nThe story isn\u0027t about the plot, however. It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking. The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film. Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.\n\nSee this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.\n\n**** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "2 things: Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. Two of the finest people in their craft when join hands, you can expect nothing short of a BLOCKBUSTER, in every sense of the word. Saw this movie first day, first show and might I add the occupancy of the theater was about 60% for a 10:00 am show. That speaks for itself about the enthusiasm that people had about the movie. The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir\u0027s best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don\u0027t think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt\u0027s. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",

      "reviewBody": "Winter Sleep is a masterpiece by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film shining with literary eloquence and incisive social criticism. \n\nAydin (\"intellectual\" in Turkish) is a failed former actor, now a hotel owner with sufficient inheritance to make him command the stage as a condescending \"king\" of a village in Cappadocia. He feels licensed to instruct, intrude and judge, not only on his pitiable tenants, but also on his disaffected young wife Nihal and divorced self-doubting sister Necla. This sentiment ostensibly extends to poor, uneducated and religious classes of the country, making Aydin a stereotype of the Turkish elite. The brutal taming of the horse is an allegory of his marriage; young and pretty Nihal is just another decorative item in his life, not an individual with her own rights and pursuits. Aydin also epitomizes a male-dominated society, cutting across levels of education and affluence. \n\nA glimmer of hope comes with a stone breaking the glass. While ruthlessly and decisively able to overpower everyone else in his reign, Aydin is disturbingly challenged by a stubborn 10 year-old boy Ilyas (Arabic equivalent of Elijah, a harbinger of the Messiah). \n\nPutting the lens on the perpetually pretending psyche of the western-styled intellectual, Winter Sleep portrays the Turkish nation struggling between the East and the West. Aydin claims to have ideals and ideas but has no intention to make a difference for the good, does not even attempt to empathize with his fellow citizens. His articulate quote from Shakespeare echoes a confession. \n\nIt\u0027s no coincidence that Nuri Bilge Ceylan was charmed by Chekhov, a like-minded author from yet another nation torn between civilizations. \n\nHats off to 2014 Palme d\u0027Or judges for their audacity. By recognizing the value of Ceylan\u0027s work, they have enticed global audiences to risk 3 hours 16 minutes of their time to a non-commercial film, a feast of cinematography and acting bundled with literary gratification.",
