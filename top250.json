      "reviewBody": "Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled. Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting. It\u0027s possible to see \"Yojimbo\u0027s\" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa\u0027s films, the fact that the characters\u0027 motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.\n\nWonderful images, and skillful direction that keeps the pace of the storytelling tight and tells most of the story through images -- this is the kind of film that is so good it can be watched a silent film without losing too much of its impact or meaning.\n\nI think that if Kurosawa had spent more of his time in litigation and less making movies, he might have made a living for the rest of his life off all the movies that have ripped off this movie. Certainly Eastwood\u0027s \"Man with No Name\" character owes a lot to Mifune\u0027s contribution; not only in Leone\u0027s films (the first of which borrows its entire plot from Kurosawa; a court settlement ensued which made sure Kurosawa made most of the profits from \"Fistful of Dollars\" in Asia his own) but also in Eastwood\u0027s best film as a director -- \"High Plains Drifter\", which borrows scenes such as Eastwood\u0027s rebuke of the villagers from \"Yojimbo\". \n\nThe really funny thing about all this, and what not too many American critics or audiences have noted, is that \"Yojimbo\" is itself a western. All the ingredients for a western are here, and the film\u0027s plot and style obviously owe a debt to Zinnemann\u0027s \"High Noon\". \"Yojimbo\" even borrows the device of time, setting up a confrontation at 3:00 a.m. as shouted by the town crier. I like \"Yojimbo\" better than \"High Noon\", so I don\u0027t want to go too far into this line of thought....",

      "reviewBody": "In a recent biography of Billy Wilder, Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen. I can\u0027t praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that.\n\nTyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden. She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate. When she\u0027s murdered, Scotland Yard arrests Power.\n\nPower\u0027s solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton. Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case. Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor\u0027s advice.\n\nThe original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife. Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr. and Mrs. Vole. So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957, but lost to Alec Guinness. \n\nMarlene Dietrich plays Mrs. Vole. She\u0027s a war bride over from Germany and she\u0027s got her own agenda going. Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film. Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself, but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration, the element of surprise would have been lost in the film. Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon legal system\u0027s goal is justice. Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution.",

      "reviewBody": "There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I\u0027ve only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that\u0027s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nMy favorite thing about this film is how it has created it\u0027s own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it\u0027s atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can\u0027t be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it\u0027s pace will seem slow to most it\u0027s intensity is impossible to miss. \n\nI can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn\u0027t have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don\u0027t know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I\u0027m talking about. I have a good feeling and I\u0027m hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven\u0027t read anything on this films page and I\u0027m sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I\u0027m praying you enjoy this film and experience it\u0027s one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy.",

Bottom line, Warrior is a well written and directed emotional roller coaster that will have you at the edge of your seat. With a star studded cast and top notch acting, the performances were solid and believable. Nick Nolte in particular did a fantastic job with his role and will have you nearly in tears. As the movie progresses you will be torn on what you would like to see happen for the climax of this entertaining thrill ride. Movies with this much emotional power connected to the characters only come around every once in a while.

      "reviewBody": "John \"Scottie\" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn\u0027t mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she\u0027s obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson\u0027s obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... \n\nVertigo is Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D\u0027Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. \n\nVery much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson\u0027s fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante\u0027s Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. \n\nTechnically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann\u0027s score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart\u0027s ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn\u0027t harnessed on too many other occasions. \n\nVertigo is a film that I myself wasn\u0027t too taken with on my first viewing, it\u0027s only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 \n\nThe opening film of this year\u0027s festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted \u0027talking\u0027 dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.\n\nThis isn\u0027t slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.\n\nVisually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can\u0027t help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.\n\nI have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.\n\nAnyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.\n\nUp is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!",

      "name": "A Fitting End",
      "reviewBody": "There may never be another real western. Clint appears to be done with the genre and there really isn\u0027t anyone else I can think of that can do it Properly. Sergio Leone is gone. William Wellman is gone. Sam Peckinpah is gone. John Huston is gone. John Ford is gone. Howard Hawks is gone.\n\nKevin Costner tries hard but he just doesn\u0027t get it. Dances With Wolves wasn\u0027t really a western. It wasn\u0027t even an anti-western. It was more like a political indictment of the actions of the Americans of the time. For all that I did enjoy it.\n\nMost of the others since Unforgiven are movies where somebody decides to put the characters on a horse, but the story is just generic pap. Nobody has the balls to make something with a meaning.\n\nI will grant that Deadwood is a truly excellent series but it isn\u0027t a movie.\n\nThat\u0027s why I believe that Unforgiven is a fitting end to the western genre. I won\u0027t get all rhapsodic and spout a bunch of crap about how Clint made this movie as a symbol of the end of the western. Cuz that\u0027s a load of crap. The script had been around since the early 70s when things were still going strong. What it is, is a movie that shows us that there is no black and white in any time. There are only shades of grey.\n\nIt is also just as dirty and violent as things actually were for most people in that era. Life was comparatively cheap and most people didn\u0027t have much hope of justice. The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.\n\nGood guys didn\u0027t wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy. Some were violent and corrupt braggarts and bullies. Little Bill mocks English Bob\u0027s self-promotion, but at the same time he knocks Bob down he builds himself up. He doesn\u0027t bother with courts or judges and he is his own executioner. He isn\u0027t motivated by any innate sense of justice when he deals with any criminal elements. It\u0027s more that he takes it as an insult to his own power.\n\nWilliam Munny is a killer, plain and simple. He has human feelings but basically he is unrepentant. He changed for his wife, but like many changes it wasn\u0027t permanent. He won\u0027t sleep with a whore but when he needs money he is willing to kill for it. At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him. A classic anti-hero.\n\nRather than being about the end of the Western genre I believe that it is actually an ode to what came before it. Sergio Leone would have been proud.",

Although the movie is 2 h 15 min long and its a black and white \"old\" movie don\u0027t be fooled - this is a great movie that makes you think about your life and especially the people you love and that you have to love them while their are still here with you, because life is very short and better make most of it with the people you love.

      "reviewBody": "An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I\u0027ve met, you\u0027ve met and we\u0027ve all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved in\n\nare most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of \"Human Traffic\" and the somber tone of \"My name is Joe\" and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of \"Perfect day\" and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise. Superb.",

      "reviewBody": "The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar\u0027s WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald\u0027s Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I\u0027ll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar \"to infinity and beyond!\" The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid\u0027s movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy\u0027s age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy\u0027s age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don\u0027t have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",

What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",

      "reviewBody": "From the brilliant \"Walt Disney of Japan\", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that\u0027s simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.\n\nSometimes you feel like you\u0027re not watching an animated children\u0027s movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There\u0027s no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.\n\nMiraculously, Totoro doesn\u0027t talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).\n\nI loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo\u0027s world.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.",

Scout and Jem are portrayed brilliantly, considering the ages of the children who played them, and they, as with everything else in the production, are true to the book\u0027s spirit. Gregory Peck is perfect as the unflappable Atticus Finch, and deserved his Oscar. The music is worthy of praise, especially for the climatic scene, and the raw emotion and feeling of the book is amply conveyed. All of the cast are well cast, and it\u0027s interesting to ponder how much this film, at the time, would\u0027ve shocked. That the book explores racism and outsiders in a southern town, through the eyes of a child is genius and works very nicely here. The only problems are minor- much of the book\u0027s counter-balancing humour was left out, certain characters are omitted (Dolphus Raymond and Aunt Alexandra), and some of the book\u0027s early characterisation is missed. Aside from these gripes, this is a magical film and a \"must-see,\" as a companion piece to the classic novel. 9/10",

This might well be her best performance ever.\n\nThe part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.\n\nAlthough the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes\u0027 stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.\n\nApart from McDormand\u0027s performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.\n\nAnd then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn\u0027t know the difference between polo and polio.\n\nIt is hard to mention something negative about this film. \u0027Three Billboards\u0027 is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can\u0027t imagine anyone not enjoying it.",

      "reviewBody": "What is evil? What is hate? How low can an individual go with one\u0027s actions and still be considered human....? These, quite possibly, are the biggest questions raised in There Will Be Blood.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis, the tycoons at the helm of this dig for moral oil, tell a story that takes the archetypal anti-heroes of \u0027Citizen Kane\u0027 and Travis Bickle of \u0027Taxi Driver\u0027 to a whole new, 21st-century level. The film, using Lewis\u0027s character Daniel Plainview, walks through incredibly dangerous cinematic territory that questions religion, plays with the nature of greed and hate and evil, and with it all, draws terrifying parallels to the world we live in today. The film and its main character claw so deep through the limits of humanity and the landscape of hell, that you\u0027ll be thanking the Good Lord for the silver screen that divides you from this horrible world Paul Thomas Anderson has portrayed. But despite how safe you may seem in your cushy seat, you will undoubtedly walk out of the theater with all kinds of new demons and ghosts buzzing in your head and ripping away at your subconscious. In this way, Anderson has abandoned his primary previous influence of Robert Altman to take more of a Stanley Kubrick direction, creating moral allegories that creep into your psyche and don\u0027t ever leave. You should be scared. Very Scared.",

The suits might be more expensive but the people who wear them are just as sick and violent as their street-mob counterparts. Sardonic in humor and unflinching in showing the depravity of its characters, it marks somewhat of a different approach to the world of stock-trading than Oliver Stone\u0027s \"Wall Street\".\n\nWhere Stone seems more in line with Bertold Brecht who considered theater (or in this case film) a moral institution, does Scorsese take the position of the omnipresent observer of the dark side of the American and in many cases the human dream.\n\nLeonard DiCaprio gives another stellar performance of great intensity and even greater tragedy while this tale of corruption, greed and self-righteousness unfolds.\n\nIt\u0027s a vast panorama that shows how during the last twenty-five to thirty years gullibility as well as our innate greed make all of us accomplices in this never-ending pyramid scheme far away from any reality.\n\nOne could almost hear Scorsese\u0027s clerical background come to the fore again, according to which nobody is without sin, and therefore we are all susceptible to corruption.\n\nIt is our decision on which side we choose to live that makes the difference.

I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited \u0027The Usual Suspects\u0027 is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-",

The film also wants to take a philosophical look at free will vs. a higher power and reality vs. fantasy. It doesn\u0027t always work as the satire often keeps you from thinking too deeply about the underlying themes and the philosophical stuff keeps the satire from biting as well as it could. Credit engaging performances and solid and thoughtful direction from Weir for keeping things afloat and entertaining. There are some great cinematic moments here. I loved the \"stolen kiss on the beach at night\" and \"Cue the sun!\"\n\nIn the end this film is closer in spirit to psychological dramas and sci-fi movies where a person suddenly realizes they are the pawn in some grand experiment or a prisoner in an alien world than it is to anything in our current \"reality TV\" obsessed culture. Eventually it touches on a very basic conflict all humans must face (most people do so in childhood, some I fear never do). The universe does not revolve around us. In the closing moments we are excited for Truman because he finally realizes there is a whole new world out there to explore, but also slightly saddened because we know all to well that he will never be able to return to that idyllic \"childhood\" existence. How\u0027s it going to end? Who knows...but things will never be the same.",

A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.\n\nThe whole thing is quite good, but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians, leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbinding--the kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia, the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes, Dobbs\u0027 burgeoning madness--these are the moments that make this film one for the ages.\n\nAt its best, film noir (which this most certainly is--Western surroundings or no) makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watching--we start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.\n\nA magnificent film--one of the few great screen tragedies.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve always thought \"The Third Man\" (**1/2 out of ****) one of the most overrated movies I\u0027ve ever seen 4 or 5 times. Setting aside the admittedly dazzling photography and editing, we have a plot that\u0027s as difficult to follow and riddled with holes and loose ends as the one for \"The Big Sleep.\" If we assume that Harry Lime is the \"third man\" who drove the truck that killed the medical orderly that was informing on him to the police (in fact, this is never made clear), wouldn\u0027t it have been a simple matter for the authorities (or anyone else) to identify the body and discover that it was not Harry Lime? Didn\u0027t the police interview the driver of the truck? How could Lime and his cohorts have possibly gotten away with the faking of his death when he was the most notorious and sought after racketeer in Vienna? The pretext for Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) being in the city at all is awfully weak. (The narration mentions a vague \"some sort of a job.\") Why would Harry want a friend from America that he hasn\u0027t seen for 10 years to come to Vienna to write about his operations? The less publicity the better it would seem to me. It\u0027s also extremely ambiguous whether or not his mistress (Alida Valli) knew that Harry was dead. The first time that Martins sees Lime he\u0027s lingering outside her apartment house as if waiting to go in, and then she does everything she can to make sure that Harry eludes the authorities. In fact, her obtuse behavior throughout the film is baffling. (I\u0027m inclined to believe that she was in on the whole deception.) Perhaps Carol Reed and co. needed audacious cinematic razzle-dazzle and oblique dialogue to cover up the fact that their story makes minimal sense. And that jangling zither music! Time and again it intrudes upon scenes that were meant to evoke tension and atmosphere and dissipates both. After the 4th or 5th repetition of the \"Third Man Theme\", I was ready to turn on the \"mute\" button! (These comments are based on the original 104 minute version.)",

      "name": "\"The Thing\" is John Carpenter\u0027s masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!",
      "reviewBody": "A classic film. John Carpenter\u0027s \"The Thing\" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?\n\nSeriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. \n\nIn my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I\u0027ll put any of \"The Thing\u0027s\" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven\u0027t seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see \"The Thing\" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who\u0027s your friend? Who\u0027s the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you\u0027ve never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?\n\n\"Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.\" \n\nJohn Carpenter\u0027s The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero\u0027s Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.\n\nThe basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell\u0027s outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.\n\nIt is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80\u0027s ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! \u0027The Thing\u0027 is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell\u0027s characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt\u0027s best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

      "reviewBody": "Many people look back at the films of James Cameron and suggest that the smaller, the budget, the tighter the limitations, the better the end product. Films like Avatar, Titanic and True Lies had huge budgets and drew in even bigger box office but many still yearn for the Cameron that gave us The Terminator and Aliens which were huge movies but packed a far bigger punch artistically. My feelings all these years on are that Cameron has earned the right to make those huge movies but i have to admit to preferring his earlier body of work. The Terminator is a nightmarish, time travelling science fiction film told at a breakneck pace and delivered with confidence and style. The film has a very gritty, underground look to it and does a great job of telling its story amid the frenetic action. There is also a huge slice of horror and suspense thrown in, an impression that has diminished in the years since it\u0027s release due to inferior sequels. Viewed as a standalone piece however, The Terminator is fine piece of work from a director with a very clear vision.Everyone knows that The Terminator is the film that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger but when i look back at the film, it has heart and its the Michael Biehn character, Kyle Reese, that provides it Artistically speaking,Cameron might be well advised that less is more.",

There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.\n\nWithout unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman\u0027s private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.\n\nAs a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10",

      "reviewBody": "Stephen King may have said the master director knew nothing about horror, but that simply is not true. That is a too biased opinion for anyone to go on given that he wrote the book, which Kubrick based his wonderful film ever so loosely on. And at any rate, faithful or not, KUBRICK\u0027s Shining-the BEST crafted genre film of the 80\u0027s- performs it\u0027s duty as a fright flick, and then some.\n\nThere are appropriately no words strong enough to convey the haunting beauty of the visuals showcased throughout the movie, from the drive to the Overlook to the final chase in the hedgemaze the movie is a feast for the eyes as it is for the mind. And it IS a feast for the mind as The Shining is as psychological as horror gets, toying relentlessly, and expertly with your emotions and expectations(some could even say SADISTICALLY), throwing something in that\u0027s completely out of left field and never, ever letting you catch your breath between the now classic shocks as the movie speeds toward it\u0027s memorable conclusion in the last half hour.\n\nKudos are in order for Kubrick, a director of the old school style, who builds an eerie atmosphere by exercising total control over the filmic environment, manipulating everything down to the tiniest detail to suit the needs of the picture, yet filming with a coldly detatched, objective eye, as though Kubrick were making a documentary about these events. This would account for the dialouge, which-thankfully-is not the typical phoney balloney Hollywood banter (Kubrick detractors/King purists usually bitch about this the most, having been weaned on the phony nature of \u0027Hollywood talk\u0027, which is usually nothing at all like real talk. Many of us speak \u0027on the nose\u0027, and do not try to convey subtext through use of carefully chosen words that articulate our state of being without being direct.) In this light, Shelley Duvall must be commended for her performance which is very naturalistic. It does not seem like acting at all. She is not concerned with glamour, nor does she clutter her performance with typical acting chops, but rather she is solely focussed on hitting the emotional highpoints of her character as \u0027Wendy\u0027 gradually comes to realize that her husband is a madman. And let\u0027s face it folks, how many of us would like a million bucks when placed in a situation like that? Who does NOT look like a blubbering idiot when they are hysterical? That\u0027s what I thought, so what did you expect? She was great. To say nothing of the rest of the cast.",

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. \n\nThe only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.\n\nI didn\u0027t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don\u0027t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.\n\nNo action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it\u0027s technical merits - I don\u0027t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",

      "name": "A Duel for Art: a Hero *for* our Time",
      "reviewBody": "Art as vocation; art as religion; art as the purpose of life: The Archers team of Powell and Pressburger aimed high with \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 - and scored a bull\u0027s-eye. The film is a feast for the senses: cinematography (by Archers regular Jack Cardiff), music, acting and ballet are combined to make a magnificent whole. Emeric Pressburger\u0027s story appears simple at first glance, but is a challenging study of the value and purpose of art, and of aestheticism as a creed (a term not used lightly). It is given life by some of the most talented dancers of the era: Leonid Myasin/Massine as lovable Grisha; Ludmilla Tchérina as glamorous, flighty Irina; Robert Helpmann - who choreographed the title ballet - as Ivan; Marie Rambert as herself, and Moira Shearer (Ashton\u0027s \u0027Cinderella\u0027) highly appealing as the heroine Vicky. The non-dancing cast is led by Archers regulars Anton Walbrook (magnificent - why no Oscar?) and Marius Goring (so convincing I ended up wanting to slap him).\n\nThe plot combines Andersen\u0027s fable, \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 with elements of Dyagilev\u0027s relationships with Nizhinskii and Myasin, and the effect of the younger men\u0027s marriages. Dancer Vicky Page (Shearer) and composer Julian Craster (Goring) are taken up and encouraged by ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook). \n\nBoris is the film\u0027s dominant character, an obvious portrait of Sergei Pavlovich Dyagilev (1872-1929), one of 20C culture\u0027s greatest figures, the driving force of \u0027Mir Iskusstva\u0027 and the \u0027Ballets Russes\u0027. However, his Scots-Russian surname alludes to Mikhail Yur\u0027evich Lermontov (1814-41), poet and author of \u0027A Hero of Our Time\u0027, Pushkin\u0027s successor as the voice of Russian Romanticism. Boris is an aesthete and perfectionist, a true believer in the religion of art. All his passions and energies are channelled into bringing out the best in the company that is his \u0027family\u0027. He demands equal dedication from his protégés. He believes that if you have an outstanding talent, your primary duty is to give that talent its fullest expression, not fritter it away through mundane distractions and dalliances. Human relationships are transitory: what matters is the art. It is a stern, unsentimental creed, but a noble one.\n\nVicky and Julian begin an affair during the creation of the new ballet, \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 (which we see in full, and has, in its sacrificial death-by-dancing, echoes of Stravinskii\u0027s \u0027Sacre du Printemps\u0027, choreographed by Nizhinskii for Dyagilev). Their love tests their commitment to Lermontov\u0027s ethic. What makes the conflict interesting and effective is that it is not trivialised as sexual rivalry: Boris is discreetly signalled as gay, like Dyagilev - something reinforced by the casting of Walbrook. (It is unnecessary to highlight the courage, in 1948, of placing centre-stage a dignified, powerful, non-caricatured gay character, played by a gay actor who had escaped Nazi persecution.) The struggle is between real Romanticism - hence Boris\u0027s sharing his name with the Byronic poet - and mere \u0027romance\u0027. But the brutal climax, bringing together Andersen\u0027s story with suitably Russian overtones of \u0027Anna Karenina\u0027, is an evasion of decision: a character choosing death rather than commitment one way or the other. The final scene combines tragic lyricism with awareness of the unnecessary waste: and the dance, of course, goes on.\n\nMy understanding of and relationship with \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 has changed and deepened with time. In girlhood, I was inclined to be relatively indulgent to Vicky and Julian. In middle age, they seem plain self-indulgent. Julian, frankly, isn\u0027t worth any sacrifice. Ballet is a \"second-rate form of expression\", he says in a quarrel with Boris - who, of course, launched his career. (If Boris had punched *him* instead of the mirror, how I\u0027d have cheered!) He regards Vicky as a muse for his own fulfilment as a composer, while she frets with frustration, her pointe shoes in a drawer, her own artistic fulfilment denied. Their separate beds after marriage seem a revealing insight, not merely \u002740s film censorship. On the spectrum of fictional obnoxiousness, Julian\u0027s not far behind Angel Clare in \u0027Tess of the d\u0027Urbervilles\u0027. Boris\u0027s manipulations are actually *less* selfish - directed towards enabling Vicky to express *her* creativity to the maximum - not bury her talent in a drawer.\n\nYes - Boris\u0027s passionately held vocation and values now evoke my strongest sympathies and recognition/identification as a fellow \u0027true believer\u0027 in art (and long-time Dyagilev-ite). Young sentimentalists may hate him (he knows \"adolescent nonsense\" when he hears it!), but he speaks hard truths and much wisdom. Personal relationships are fragile; a dancer\u0027s active career can be short. If you have a gift, service to it must come first: it is a sacred duty. Domesticity can wait. Yes, he is autocratic, temperamental: prophets and visionaries usually are. And what is his job? To unite other exceptionally gifted people from diverse disciplines - painting, costume, music, dance - with *their* competing egos and artistic temperaments, to create the multifaceted art of ballet. Herding cats is easier! And yet he is capable of generosity and forgiveness, as with the prodigal Irina. A complex, moving, genuinely heroic figure, \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 is more his film than Vicky and Julian\u0027s.\n\nBut what went wrong with British film? The Archers made \u0027The Red Shoes\u0027 in 1948; now we have vacuous romantic-comedy/chick-flick pap or drab kitchen-sinkers that might as well be TV soap episodes, betokening a loss of cultural and intellectual confidence. (In visual flair, has The Archers\u0027 torch passed to Baz Luhrmann? Time will tell!) The present cultural climate treats the arts as an optional add-on to civilisation, rather than a defining part of what it means to be civilised. The arts are constantly called upon to justify their existence in commercial or social engineering terms, not for their intrinsic worth. A film, then, in which the most compelling character advocates Art for Art\u0027s Sake - art as a sacred calling - flings a gauntlet in the face of a market-driven, anti-intellectual, anti-beauty, utilitarian society. Sergei Pavlovich/Boris Lermontov, where are you now we need you?!!!",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027m not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can\u0027t pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage\u0027s initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can\u0027t get enough. \n\n Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes\u0027 later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini\u0027s enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!\u0027). \n\nThis is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed.",

      "reviewBody": "I won\u0027t say it\u0027s an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan\u0027s broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it\u0027s obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn\u0027t even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don\u0027t get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That\u0027s quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That\u0027s until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn\u0027t make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn\u0027t so adorable. He didn\u0027t remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don\u0027t even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It\u0027s after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it\u0027s a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".",

      "reviewBody": "This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways! It\u0027s not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can\u0027t speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there\u0027s no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house\u0027 has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman\u0027s head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I\u0027ve seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD\u0027s flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody\u0027s job often was), I\u0027d be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody\u0027s turn! :-)",

But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you\u0027ll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.\n\nI really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.\n\nThe plot is one of the best movie plots I\u0027ve seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.\n\nMy favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",

      "reviewBody": "It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB\u0027s records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.\n\nPeter Jackson\u0027s The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.\n\nThis second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).\n\nGollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of \"Smeagol\" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...\n\nA truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.\n\nProbably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for \"The Two Towers\" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill\u0027s performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to \"The Battle of Helms Deep\", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.\n\nViggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen\u0027s portrayal in Jackson\u0027s frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen\u0027s Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. \"Definitive\" is not strong enough of a word.\n\nIf you still view Jackson\u0027s epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don\u0027t pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings \"The Two Towers\" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.\n\nGo, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",

      "reviewBody": "Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.\n\nWhich of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien\u0027s books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.\n\nThe heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.\n\nThe casting and acting are superb.\n\nThe film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy\u0027s well-earned crown.\n\nReturn of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you\u0027ll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien\u0027s grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien\u0027s examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.\n\nEven more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien\u0027s world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien\u0027s book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien\u0027s epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the trailers for \"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy. But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie. I thought it was a fabulous work of art.\n\nI thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story. It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider\u0027s advantage on the rest of the audience. Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen. Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.\n\nThe entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes. The Shire was almost exactly as I\u0027d pictured it. Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real. Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same. The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it\u0027s amazing that \"Fellowship\" was filmed in one country.\n\nNow to the characters. All I can say is, \"Wow.\" I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I\u0027d created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn\u0027t want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least. Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable. You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood\u0027s pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits. He also cries like a little girl. But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character. The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too. Sean Astin (\"Rudy\" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien\u0027s telling. Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless. Viggo Mortensen is outstanding. He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting. Some may have complained about Arwen\u0027s character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change. In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in \"The Return of the King\" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen. Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are. Speaking of Elves, I can\u0027t help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas. Bloom captured the archer\u0027s very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas\u0027s bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style. He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film. Gimli was pompous and brave, as well. He is well-represented in the movie. Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong. Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior. Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond. He was noble and cold at the same time. And Gandalf. What more can be said of Ian McKellan\u0027s showcase portrayal of the wizard? He was magnificent. He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children. Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.\n\nPeter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places. Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron\u0027s mouth water. Knowing that \"The Two Towers\" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",

And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can\u0027t tell in words how much I love the song \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.",

      "reviewBody": "While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplin\u0027s later features, \"The Kid\" is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair, and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen. Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.\n\nWhile it\u0027s a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin\u0027s most efficiently designed movies. Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both. Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well.\n\n\"The Kid\" is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies. Here, the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorable.\n\nThis is one of Chaplin\u0027s very best movies by any measure. If you enjoy silent comedies, don\u0027t miss it.",

      "reviewBody": "I just got back from a special-screening of \"The Help\" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.\n\nNow, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as \u0027Skeeter\u0027? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won\u0027t go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.\n\nCasting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that \"the blacks had to be \u0027saved\u0027 by the whites\" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real \"heroes\" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).\n\nI can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what \"The Help\" strides and aims for, without making it \"cheesy\". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks\u0027 side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less \"mean\" or \"degrading\" to any sides.\n\nThere are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn\u0027t have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn\u0027t even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.\n\nAll in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\n\nMovie rating: 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Having doubts about seeing this movie because of the length (3 hours can be death to a film).I was so surprised that I didn\u0027t look at my watch once throughout the whole movie. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he\u0027s carrying his own movie. If you haven\u0027t seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to \u0027The Shawshank Redemption\u0027 and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "This is a splendid film about a daring breakout from inescapable Nazi concentration camp , Stalag Luft North , with all star cast and magnificently realized by John Sturges . It\u0027s partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill . The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered \u0027putting all the rotten eggs in one basket\u0027 as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .\n\nThis exciting story contains thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting and support , as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character , ¨The Cooler King¨ , remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind , James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout , furthermore , James Garner as American officer , the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum, among others . Colorful, atmospheric cinematography shot in Bavaria,Germany, by Daniel Fapp and perfectly remastered . Excellent production design and art direction with evocative sets by Fernando Carrere. Rousing and lively soundtrack , nowadays a classic score, by Elmer Bernstein . This blockbuster is followed by inferior TV sequel with Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch , Ian McShane and directed Jud Taylor who played to Goff in the original version . The motion picture is magnificently directed By John Sturges , author of various classic Western as ¨Escape from Fort Bravo, Gunfight at the OK Corral, The law and Jake Wade, Magnificent seven¨ and also realized another nice wartime film as ¨ The eagle has landed ¨ . Rating : Two thumbs up , essential and indispensable watching , a real must see.",

      "name": "Immortal classic movie with dual character for Chaplin as barber Jew and Dictator Hynkel",
      "reviewBody": "This ingenious and innovate comedy packs many priceless moments and great sense of pace , though overlong . Chaplin\u0027s satire with several classic scenes , he has dual role as a Jewish barber and dictator Hynkel , an offensive portrayal of Hitler . Then the barber is mistaken for the Hitlerian tyrant and there happens bemusing events . Funny and extraordinary acting all around , as the stunning co-stars Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini-alike) , Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler-alike) and Billy Gilbert as Herring (Goering) . Chaplin\u0027s first spoken film is brilliantly photographed by Karl Struss . This splendid film contains numerous amusing scenes , the funniest are the followings : 1) The one when during the WWI the barber-soldier along with a co-pilot are flying in a turned plane without to be aware 2) When Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tells overacting speeches , including a twisted microphone 3) Hynkel playing with an enormous world balloon 4) The Jew-barber shaving a man while fitting to Hungarian Dance : number 5 by Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than other in a barber\u0027s chair , among them .\n\nProduction on the movie started in 1937 and shot in 539 days when not nearly as many people believed Nazism was a menace , as was the case when it was released in 1940 ; however , this film was ultimately upstaged as the first anti-Nazi film satire . Hitler banned movie exhibition to the Germans due to its satire of him , and put him in his death list after his proposed conquest of America . The movie is co-starred by Paulette Goddard , third of his four wives , they were married in 1936 , although no announcement of the marriage was made later, one time finished The Great Dictator . The picture was released in 1940 , when Chaplin had survived a moral scandal by a paternity suit but a brush with the House of Un-American Activities was the signal for the USA to refuse him re-entry from Britain and he fled to Switzerland . This movie was Charles Chaplin\u0027s biggest-ever box-office hit , grossing about $5 million at the time.",

      "reviewBody": "That it was directed by Wes Anderson (who has a unique style that really fascinates, but admittedly not everybody will like or warm to his style) and that the cast is so stellar were reasons enough to see \u0027The Grand Budapest Hotel\u0027 in the first place, as well as its many accolades and critical acclaim.\n\nWhile it isn\u0027t quite flawless, and it is easy to see why a number of people don\u0027t like or will not like it (due to a lot of the cast\u0027s roles being pretty short, only Gustave and Zero being fully fleshed out of the characters and those who have a problem with Anderson\u0027s style), \u0027The Grand Budapest Hotel\u0027 is a visually stunning, hugely entertaining, wonderfully weird and impeccably cast and acted film.\n\nIt really stuns visually, with cinematography that is not only clever in technique but also gorgeous in aesthetic and tight, fluid editing. The costumes, production design and hair and make-up richly deserved their Oscar/Academy Award wins, the costume and production design have a lusciously colourful fairy-tale feel while also given substance by the bleakly atmospheric quality that reflects the crime drama aspect of the story brilliantly.\n\nAlexandre Desplat also received an Oscar, and with its hauntingly hypnotic and entrancing tones it richly deserved it as to me it was by far the best score of those nominated. Anderson directs superbly, the story balances darkness and quirkiness to great effect (the prison scene is unforgettable) and it\u0027s never too simplistic or convoluted (though of course the visuals, dialogue and performances make much more of an impact) and the screenplay is a sublime mixture of the dark, the quirky, the witty and the subtle delivered with rapid-fire.\n\n\u0027The Grand Budapest Hotel\u0027 boasts an impeccable cast and pretty much everybody does a splendid job, though many of the roles are short. My only criticism of the film is that Harvey Keitel and Saoirse Ronan are underused and just get lost amongst everything else, an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton also has little to do but still gives a bat-out-of-hell performance.\n\nBill Murray, F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson give very entertaining performances, while Edward Norton is delightfully droll and Adrien Brody and especially Willem Dafoe bring sinister foreboding to the film. Some may say that Tony Revolori is overshadowed by the more experienced cast members (being the only newcomer in a large cast of big names), but to me he more than holds his own and effectively plays it straight. The film belongs to Ralph Fiennes, in what is essentially the heart of the film, while he has always been a fine actor he has not given a performance this brilliant in years, never knew he could be so riotously funny.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and a hotel well worth revisiting more than once if to one\u0027s taste. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

      "name": "Gold is the operative word here.",
      "reviewBody": "The Gold Rush is pure gold. It was Charlie Chaplin\u0027s third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp. \n\nThis movie should be counted among Chaplin\u0027s best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I\u0027ve also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy\u0027s immortal geniuses.\n\nHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college\u0027s silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. \n\n Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven\u0027t even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that\u0027s also on the disc.\n\nThe viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard. On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!\n\nAlso, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD. But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.\n\nThe first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I\u0027ve ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies. \n\nAnd the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they\u0027ve seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.\n\nI don\u0027t say this to sound pretentious. I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted. It\u0027s hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years. \n\nFor example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin\u0027s first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema\u0027s potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously. Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.\n\nThe joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy. This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle\u0027s aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp\u0027s grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.\n\nOne pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing. \n\nWhen Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm. This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD. \n\nThe second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn\u0027t sustain the entire film at the cabin. Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film\u0027s third act. \n\n I don\u0027t want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn\u0027t seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.\n\nMack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat. Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid. From what I\u0027ve seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. \n\n The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today\u0027s more sophisticated stories and special effects. The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia\u0027s true feelings for the Tramp.\n\nBut the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that\u0027s a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today. What a shame.\n\nRating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)",

      "reviewBody": "This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because \"Flesh and the Devil\" was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton\u0027s other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won\u0027t speak to him again until he is in uniform.\n\nMeanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster\u0027s train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl\u0027s captivity by the Union army.\n\nForgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950\u0027s because Buster didn\u0027t preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.\n\nToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films, and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK, JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It\u0027s story driven, races to a climax, and is fueled by cute, clever, inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in \"A Southern Yankee\".",

Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view. \n\nWhatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.\n\nA young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won\u0027t soon forget as John Merrick, \"The Elephant Man.\"\n\nThis is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man\u0027s cruelty to man.

      "reviewBody": "Now I know that \u0027The Departed\u0027 is based off of the Hong Kong movie \u0027WuJianDao\u0027, but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn\u0027t stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there\u0027s the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one\u0027s perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from \u0027The Big Lebowski\u0027, by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you\u0027ll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you\u0027re a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it\u0027s great to hear \"Gimme Shelter\" again, but \"Comfortably Numb\" played in so well. It\u0027s another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio\u0027s best role since \u0027The Aviator\u0027 which was his best role since \u0027Gangs of New York\u0027, am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn\u0027t concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve now seen this film three times with a decade or more between viewings, and every time I see it I come away feeling that movies can\u0027t get any better than this. People always comment on the Viet Nam scenes, and it\u0027s true that they are as powerful and intense as any war scenes ever filmed. The Russian-roulette betting game, in both its up-river and Saigon venues, may be the most riveting, shattering plot device ever invented, as measured by the pounding of the heart.\n\n But it\u0027s the \u0027home front\u0027 scenes that stick with me through the years. I think all the steel town scenes are nearly perfect, untoppable. And that very much includes the Eastern Orthodox wedding and its sequel. When anyone tells me they were bored I just shake my head. There\u0027s no arguing with short and shallow attention spans. You\u0027re either capable of appreciating art or you\u0027re not. \n\n I do have a quibble or two. The deer-hunting scenes looked like nowhere I\u0027ve ever seen in Pennsylvania, or anywhere else East of the Rockies. I think Cimino deliberately picked an ethereal location above the clouds as a contrast to the steel town. When John Cazale and the others get loaded and act like jerks it jars on Michael, because they have brought the stupid distractions of ordinary life to an extraordinary place. This would matter less if the \u0027genius loci\u0027 were not so strongly present in the other home front scenes. I wish he had used the soft, green forested hills of Pennsylvania for the hunting.\n\n And some of the dialogue--Meryl Streep\u0027s in particular--wouldn\u0027t work on the page, and only first-rate acting by an inspired ensemble--has there ever been a better cast of young actors?--pulls it off. But these are forgivable errors in one of the finest films ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "As this movie was the most awaited movie of the decade, I obviously wanted to watch it as soon as possible. My friend won some contest online and so, I got to watch it a few days earlier FOR FREE.\n\nThe movie is everything you want it to be. The story is very well told and there is enough of Nolan-kind twists. Tom Hardy has some powerful lines as Bane but the enhanced voice doesn\u0027t work at all. But, he still does his character justice and performs to his full potential. For the first time in the trilogy, Batman wasn\u0027t the strongest. This gave a chance to Christian Bale to show off his acting skills without the mask and he did a fine job. The veterans Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine went about their job as if it was just another day at the office. But, a major surprise was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who portrays an ordinary police officer and pulls of an unexpectedly awesome performance. \n\nThe special effects, sound and action were out of the world. Nolan spent a lot of money and he made it visible in the movie. The movie connects all the dots from the previous movies and provides a fitting end to the saga. Although, personally I liked The Dark Knight better. But, TDKR certainly came very close it.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman in a way no one ever thought was possible and for making one the best trilogy of all time.",

Unlike some of today\u0027s grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography. Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson. The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito\u0027s hut is remarkable. Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men. Saito can\u0027t understand Nicholson\u0027s acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy. The film\u0027s plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined. Shears\u0027 return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge. In the film\u0027s final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean. One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.",

The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).\n\nThe first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent. I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long. But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it\u0027s your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.\n\nThe characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. The Big Lebowski is like no other film. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through. One of the Joel and Ethan Coen\u0027s best, and one of the movie industry\u0027s best comedic film of all time. You want to go see this flick.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and \"The Apartment\" catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****",

      "name": "He Said He\u0027d Be Back...and He Certainly is!",
      "reviewBody": "Who said sequels aren\u0027t any good? \"Terminator 2\" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It\u0027s dark, it\u0027s mean, and it\u0027s one tough movie. It\u0027s not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.\n\nIf there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we\u0027ve got Cameron\u0027s real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.\n\nYeah, he\u0027s \"back.\" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it\u0027s 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah\u0027s 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn\u0027t match with his age in the third. We\u0027ll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)\n\nAnother model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold\u0027s appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won\u0027t be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)\n\nWhew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn\u0027t as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it\u0027s got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn\u0027t in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor\u0027s resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.\n\nSarah doesn\u0027t trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and \"Xtreme\" edition DVDs, Sarah says, \"You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like to try and kill one of these things!\" It\u0027s an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine\u0027s central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It\u0027s important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn\u0027t trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don\u0027t like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), \"T2\" clearly has an underlying message: One, don\u0027t judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can\u0027t everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.\n\nI suppose the question on most interested viewers\u0027 minds is this: Is \"T2: Judgment Day\" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.\n\nIn some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I\u0027d choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I\u0027m glad I don\u0027t have to choose.\n\n5/5 stars.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Taxi Driver\" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the \u002770\u0027s. He already isn\u0027t a stable person to begin with (he\u0027s a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea\u0027s of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.\n\nBeauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. \n\nThe story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.\n\nThe movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.\n\nThe entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous \u0027You talking\u0027 to me?\u0027 sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.\n\nIt\u0027s still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes \"Taxi Driver\" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the \u0027classic\u0027-status. \n\nYet another essential \u002770\u0027s viewing.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Are we insecure of accepting somebodies honesty and creative genius?\n\nSure, Taare Zameen Par has moments that could have been better, but shouldn\u0027t we just try to overlook those and once, for all, applaud the effort the makers have put...\n\nand believe me it is not difficult... for there are innumerable other moments that leave you spellbound, a wet film over your eyes, a strange pain down your throat, a mild ache at your heart, but a pure smile on your lips... there are times you wish you were a kid... \n\nmay be it takes a child to love simple tales told with honesty and warmth... may be we grown ups have lost that quality we all once had... but Taare Zameen Par should touch a chord somewhere in every one\u0027s heart... we all have been after all, at least for some beautiful part of our lives, special. the film is dedicated to that special child in all of us...\n\nP.S- no one can hate it...at least i would like to think that way",

      "reviewBody": "Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer\u0027s ability to write her \u0027comeback\u0027 picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn\u0027t otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. \n\nAs a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim\u0027s butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral \u0027moral tale\u0027, it sometimes leaves a bad taste.\n\nFor all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.",

      "reviewBody": "My five children were growing up but all still at home when \u0027Return of the Jedi\u0027 came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the \u0027Star Wars\u0027 trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.\n\nAfter the fantastic \u0027Star Wars\u0027 and \u0027Empire Strikes Back\u0027 (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode \u0027Return of the Jedi\u0027 was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels\u0027 battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke\u0027s Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. \n\nMy wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",

The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven\u0027t already done so. 20 out of 10!!\n\nOh, and Han Solo shot first! \u003d)",

Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.",

      "name": "One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.",
      "reviewBody": "Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history, Stephen King. Clearly, the central character here is Gordie Lachance, from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself, given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years, such as Jerry O\u0027Connell, who played Vern, River Phoenix, who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn\u0027t died, Corey Feldman, who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence, Kiefer Sutherland, who has become an excellent and very well known actor, John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie\u0027s late brother, and of course, Richard Dreyfuss, who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult, has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.\n\nStand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959, the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting, and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train, hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately, the town\u0027s bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason, which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story, it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also, every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways, making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on, Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers, not to mention Chris\u0027s cruel brother, and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene, Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father\u0027s alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove, nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father, who hadn\u0027t laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught `eating bleach under the sink.\u0027\n\nStephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film, such as in Gordie\u0027s vehement line, `F*ck writing. I don\u0027t want to be a writer, it\u0027s a stupid waste of time!\u0027 Not only that, but there are also obvious references to his other works, such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food, and Teddy says, `This is great, what are we supposed to do, eat our feet?\u0027 People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King\u0027s short stories, `Survivor Type,\u0027 from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don\u0027t you people read these books? `The Body,\u0027 which Stand By Me was based on, is only 148 pages long, you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It\u0027s even more disturbing that `The Body\u0027 was published in the same book (Different Seasons) as a couple of King\u0027s other famous stories  `Apt Pupil\u0027 and, of course, `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\u0027\n\nStand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are, but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film  `As time went on, we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern, until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes, friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.\u0027 Instead, the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it, and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.\n\nStand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King\u0027s story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner, and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels, with the slicked back hair, the hot rods, and in the film, and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story, but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.",

      "reviewBody": "It seems to me that I see Tarkovsky\u0027 movies differently from many other people. For me this film is not \"too long\" or boring. For me this is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nWestern culture has a very long tradition of film-making. Usually typical western movie is focused on \"story\". (Of course - not always) The sharpness and tension of the movie are achieved by the big number of cuts or by the fast varying of shots or by the sudden varying of plans or by some surprising angle of camera etc. Tarkovsky don\u0027t like cuts. The number of cuts is minimal. His camera is moving like in dream (Bergman envied Tarkovsky for that), it has no angles at all. Colours are pale, \"dirty\", very tender, soft, almost black-and-white.\n\nIn a typical western movie dialog is followed by the camera. Picture is illustrating text and is subordinated to it. In Stalker text and visual image are coexisting, cooperating with each-other. Both are moving on their own ways but at the same time, somehow - harmonically. Text and picture are not subordinated, they are both independent.\n\nWhy is Tarkovsky using such a weird language? Surely not only because he wants to opposite the dogmas of western cinema. He has a positive message too. Audience of his films has to understand his films not only at the level of thinking or emotions, but at the level of much deeper consciousness. Therefore watching his movies means rather meditation than watching-TV-and-eating-popcorn. The purpose of Tarkovsky\u0027s films is to loose the mind of audiences, to wake it up to much deeper attention. So that audiences can simply watch and see.\n\nStalker is not an entertainment and is not supposed to be. It means there is no sense at all to watch Stalker, when you need some amusing entertainment. Stalker is a serious movie. It is very narrow-minded to evaluate movies on the assumption of entertainment only. Of course, we live in the world of movie-consumers, produced by powerful film-companies, demanding more and more and more exciting entertainment. Consumer doesn\u0027t understand this movie. For him it is big bore.",

I thought my love for movies is dying and I\u0027m more of a TV person now. \n\nI was wrong. \n\nThis movie (and the big short) proved to me that it wasn\u0027t me, it was actually the movies I\u0027ve seen this year.\n\nThis movie has it\u0027s flaws for sure. But the acting, script, direction, design and pace of the movie adds a lot to an already strong and heart breaking story. I was on the edge of my seat and even after the movie ended I couldn\u0027t move for a while. \n\nA well made film that I recommend to any drama fan. It certainly helped me find my love for movies again.\n\nEven with it\u0027s flaws I give it a 9.5",

      "reviewBody": "\"Movies should be like amusement parks\" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said \"People should go to them to have fun\". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you\u0027re constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you\u0027re least expecting it you\u0027re hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you\u0027ll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it\u0027s hilarious! \n\nAfter playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of\u0027 Josephine\u0027 and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for \u0027Daphne\u0027.\n\nSome Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder\u0027s directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that\u0027s not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that\u0027s the very reason it\u0027s so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it\u0027s so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! \n\nBut you can\u0027t talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full\u0027s of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. \n\nSome Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",

I\u0027m sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.\n\nAs for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him. I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs. The evil men were EVIL (\"so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel\" to quote Mike Meyers). The bumbling men were endearing. The music was great. \n\nIt was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think). Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.\n\nOh, and I never saw \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\", for whatever that\u0027s worth.",

      "name": "Bergman\u0027s Masterpiece Confronts us with the Important Question.",
      "reviewBody": "In Ingmar Berman\u0027s film masterpiece Smultronstallet (or Wild Strawberries\u0027 B\u0026W, 1957), the protagonist, an elderly professor who is facing death, has to come to face to face with a long life that has failed to answer the important questions. He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.\n\nBergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life\u0027s most important question  that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn\u0027t exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It\u0027s a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss  the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.\n\nIn one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene  only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures loss\u0027 on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.\n\nThe imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman\u0027s own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black  ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman\u0027s existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man  as futile as Sisyphus\u0027 labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor\u0027s first duty is to ask for forgiveness.\u0027). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.\u0027).\n\nIzak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.\n\nThe film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic  a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?\u0027 `Don\u0027t ask me.\u0027 I hope that all of us will fare better when confronted with the film\u0027s important question.",

      "name": "All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...",
      "reviewBody": "There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn\u0027t be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese\u0027s film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane\u0027s already great story.\n\nShutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you\u0027ve read the novel multiple times, you\u0027ll feel like you\u0027re reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing \"the most dangerous patients,\" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.\n\nI often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall\u0027s The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.\n\nAs with Scorsese and DiCaprio\u0027s previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn\u0027t go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That\u0027s not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility\u0027s faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.\n\nHowever, that mood isn\u0027t sacrificed and \"spooky\" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a \"best of\" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my \"Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows\" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he\u0027s quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn\u0027t mean anything though if you don\u0027t have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn\u0027t among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there\u0027s always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.\n\nWith a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn\u0027t rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.\n\nShutter Island isn\u0027t just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I\u0027ve been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I\u0027ve been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those \"in the know.\" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I\u0027ll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in \"Spoiler\" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing.",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen Kurosawa\u0027s Seven Samurai at least 10 times, I still see something new every time I watch it. I don\u0027t see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I\u0027ve always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can\u0027t understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie. He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer\u0027s attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness. Mifune\u0027s character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura. Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale. Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command. Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him. Seiji Miyaguchi as the \"expert\" warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character. Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face. The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.\n\nIn addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan. All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting. While it\u0027s similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone\u0027s Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.\n\nI can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings. You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors. If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts. \n\nThis one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt.",

I imagine most people at least know OF this movie with its famous movie-in-a-movie surrealist scene.\n\nStill, having previously heard over and over again about the brilliance of this film, I never really understood until I saw it myself. It\u0027s not just the dream-story and the surreality, it\u0027s what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.\n\nThus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it\u0027s FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There\u0027s no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of \"Pretentious!\", but still people can say \"It\u0027s amazing.\" There\u0027s no comedic conceit that says, \"Bah, just simple slapstick, it\u0027s low-culture!\" because it\u0027s rather intelligently done. And it\u0027s creative in a way that isn\u0027t like an opium-dream. It can appeal to anybody of all ages. It\u0027s one very well-done film.\n\n--PolarisDiB",

      "reviewBody": "Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.\n\nThe plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of \"Ran\", \"Kagemusha\" and \"Sword of Doom\") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think \"Wild Bunch with katanas\", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).\n\nKobayashi\u0027s direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai\u0027s performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.\n\nIf you\u0027re open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you\u0027ve ever seen.",

When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at \"The Bath House\". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called \"Sen\". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I\u0027ve watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it.

The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).\n\nThere\u0027s one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.\n\nNormally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop\u0027s encounter with the insanity of pure evil.\n\nI didn\u0027t want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I\u0027m afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Scarface\" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.\n\nIt has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind \u0027The Godfather\u0027.\n\nBut it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like \u0027The Godfather\u0027 or \u0027Goodfellas\u0027. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as \"tackiness\" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the \"remake\"! \n\nAl Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana\u0027s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn\u0027t really think much and gets angry all the time!\n\nThere is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including \u0027Gina and Elvira\u0027s theme\u0027, \u0027Push it to the limit\u0027 and the title track instrumental.\n\nThere are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony\u0027s visit to his mother\u0027s.\n\nAbout the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what \"Scarface\" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn\u0027t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn\u0027t be as effective without him!\n\nSteven Bauer shines as Tony\u0027s friend Manny.\n\nRobert Loggia is wonderful as Tony\u0027s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.\n\nThen there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.\n\nThe director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\n\n\"Scarface\" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",

      "reviewBody": "During the Normandy landings during WW2 two brothers are killed. In another part of the world another of the Ryan brothers is killed in action, leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered. A group of men, led by Captain Miller set out to reach Private Ryan and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the US.\n\nWhat can I say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws. The plot is based on a real life situation during WW2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors (and humanity) of war. This is the film\u0027s strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and, to a lesser extent, the final 20 minutes. The opening of the Normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown. I love Band of Brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story. Here the plot is still very good but can\u0027t really follow that opening.\n\nIt also sinks into sentiment a tad too often. For example Ryan\u0027s mother lives in this sort of Norman Rockwell painting that is Spielberg\u0027s vision of middle America. Also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although it\u0027s hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional, because they should be.\n\nA minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of Brits. Like Band of Brothers (which had a few cockney accents) this is an AMERICAN film  so of course they will focus on the American experience. However it would have been nice to have some British (or any other) voices or faces among the Allies. I can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful. There\u0027s nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then it\u0027s a problem. It always makes me think of the way that Michael Caine took his children back to the UK when they were taught in an US school that WW2 started in the 1940\u0027s (ie  when America joined).\n\nHowever this is a minor flaw as, in fairness, it\u0027s an American film  why be surprised when it\u0027s focus is Americans! Of the cast Hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his Oscar roles where he played to the crowd. He benefits from having a great support cast of good actors, current actors, old faces, up and comers etc. Sizemore, Burns and Farina are the good current actors. Damon, Ribsi, Diesel, Martini etc are all very good on the way up  although Damon has one of the simplest characters. They may all be slight stereotypes of Americans but it\u0027s not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases I think, although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but can\u0027t squeeze any other Allies in to the edges.\n\nOverall it is excellent despite some stereotyping, US flag waving and the usual Spielberg love of sentimentality. Even if the actual plot is flimsy Spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as I hope we\u0027ll ever be.",

They\u0027ve done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.\n\nJames Hunt\u0027s fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda\u0027s methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat.

      "reviewBody": "When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky\u0027. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky\u0027. On top of that, `Rocky\u0027 also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).\n\nThis movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It\u0027s films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u0027, `Jaws\u0027, `Saturday Night Fever\u0027 and `Network\u0027 were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting\u0027 and `The Master Of Disaster\u0027. Attracted to Rocky\u0027s reputation as \"The Italian Stallion\", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a \"nobody\" can become a \"somebody\". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky\u0027s manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark\u0027. However, the central character in Rocky\u0027s life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn\u0027t have much of a brain\u0027, the other `didn\u0027t have much of a body\u0027, so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70\u0027s was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot\u0027, but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky\u0027 is one-in-a-million.\n\nSeeing `Rocky\u0027 is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film\u0027s possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone\u0027s wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren\u0027t manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.\n\nOver 25 years on, `Rocky\u0027 still manages to let the audience\u0027s emotions explode; Rocky\u0027s blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian\u0027s alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky\u0027s inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky\u0027s determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it\u0027s message. `Rocky\u0027 illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.\n\nSimply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It\u0027s unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers\u0027, starring Gene Hackman). C\u0027mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone\u0027s masterpiece, `Rocky\u0027.",

I was just sitting there saying \"Wheres all the violence\", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.\n\nThis is one of the movies I don\u0027t get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: \"Are you gonna bark all day...\", \"I\u0027ll make you my dog\u0027s bitch\". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don\u0027t know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there\u0027s a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino\u0027s best movie. I didn\u0027t care much for the \"Kill Bill\" movies, but who cares, I\u0027m not reviewing them.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.",

      "reviewBody": "I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn\u0027t believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.\n\nAs a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can\u0027t believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I\u0027ve watched this year, not even close. I was totally amazed by her.\n\nAll in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven\u0027t been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will.",

      "reviewBody": "Hitchcock felt \u0027Rebecca\u0027, his first Hollywood film, was a compromise, but as a viewer I just can\u0027t fault it. It\u0027s a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It\u0027s also one of the most romantic movies I\u0027ve ever seen. I\u0027ve watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I\u0027m not much of an Olivier fan but he\u0027s superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter\u0027s new bride. I can\u0027t spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can\u0027t imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in \u0027Suspicion\u0027 with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but \u0027Rebecca\u0027 is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson (\u0027Laura\u0027) as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca\u0027s slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter\u0027s bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in \u0027Foreign Correspondent\u0027, and Bruce played Cary Grant\u0027s lovable pal \"Beaky\" in \u0027Suspicion\u0027. I sometimes think that Hitchcock\u0027s 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too \"old fashioned\", but for me movies like \u0027Suspicion\u0027, \u0027Saboteur\u0027, \u0027Lifeboat\u0027 and \u0027Spellbound\u0027 are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and \u0027Rebecca\u0027 is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch \u0027Rebecca\u0027!",

      "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience\u0027s thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors\u0027 private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he\u0027s looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly\u0027s) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn\u0027t trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It\u0027s a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock\u0027s first truly \u0027fifties\u0027 film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he\u0027d been doing before. There\u0027s less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it\u0027s romantic about couples and cynical about people. There\u0027s a little bit of everything in it,--it\u0027s a work of art.",

      "reviewBody": "As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that\u0027s what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. \n\nRashomon pioneered Kurosawa\u0027s dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai\u0027s wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai\u0027s spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai\u0027s version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn\u0027t want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. \n\nThe concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Film Review\n\nRang De Basanti\n\nIndia Awakens\n\nBy Nidhi Kathuria\n\nRating *****\n\n\u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word \u0027go\u0027, this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 is not a cliché patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career\u0027s best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What \u0027Mangal Pandey\u0027 couldn\u0027t do for Aamir Khan, \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027 does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn\u0027t have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her \u0027pucca Punjaban\u0027 character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called \u0027Young Guns of India\u0027 based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled \u0027Rang De Basanti\u0027. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of \u0027Mangal Pandey\u0027 completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that\u0027s what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours\u0027 souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.\n\nThe Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia\u0027s fiancé is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. \n\nRating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding",

Although I think Kurosawa has done better (\u0027Rashomon\u0027, \u0027Ikiru\u0027, \u0027Yojimbo\u0027 and of course \u0027Shichinin no Samurai\u0027) \u0027Ran\u0027 definitely belongs to his best.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can\u0027t think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There\u0027s just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.\n\nThe only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930\u0027s serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.\n\nI will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it\u0027s the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank\u0027s Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you\u0027ll surely notice the similarities.\n\nThe hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.\n\nThe action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he\u0027s a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.\n\nYou might think that it\u0027s rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of \u0027Indy\u0027 signature sound to them, that I\u0027ve not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William\u0027s classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! \n\nI\u0027m not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there\u0027s already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There\u0027s talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don\u0027t think it will happen and I don\u0027t want it to. It\u0027s perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there\u0027s the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).\n\nI am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.\n\nNow there\u0027s something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?",

      "reviewBody": "Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I\u0027m sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can\u0027t expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black\u0026white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It\u0027s not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo\u0027s paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. \n\nRaging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It\u0027s the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it\u0027s just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. \n\nIn Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn\u0027t like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn\u0027t care; \u0027cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. \n\nAt the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: \"A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!\". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",

Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino\u0027s trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated. It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film. Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit. Of course it was. Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios. The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity. Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars. Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. They all leave lasting impressions as well. Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar. Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition. Easily 5 stars out of 5.",

It is a sensational performance - for which he didn\u0027t even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you\u0027ll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma\u0027s boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in \"10 Rillington Place\" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in \"American Psycho\". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son\u0027s trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",

      "reviewBody": "Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. \n\nHugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover\u0027s each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. \n\nUpon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover\u0027s suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.\n\nThe trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard\u0027s Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. \n\nThe script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman\u0027s performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.\n\nThe film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. \n\nDenis Villeneuve\u0027s last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com",

      "reviewBody": "At the height of the Vietnam War, America\u0027s teens are drafted into the war effort to find themselves in the middle of hell. One such young man is Chris Taylor. He is placed in a squadron where two sergeants have different approaches to the war  Elias is more about surviving without being brutal or cruel, whereas Barnes is crueller, more ruthless and more violent. During the course of his term, Taylor\u0027s very soul is torn between the two men as he deals with what he must do.\n\nThe first film in Oliver Stone\u0027s unofficial trilogy is arguably the best of the three. The basic story not only shows us what the war was like for those serving but also how the different personalities come out of those involved in it. As we follow Taylor we see him change as he is influenced by those around him and by his situation. It makes for an uncomfortable film but one that\u0027s worth watching. It\u0027s certainly a better war movie than things like Wild Geese or The Dirty Dozen, simply because it\u0027s a little more real to what happens than those ones.\n\nCharlie Sheen has never been better than when he\u0027s acting for Stone. Here he gives one of his best ever performances as the innocent who is changed. Willem Dafoe is a great actor and here is no different  he also gives us one of the film\u0027s most enduring images so I\u0027m a little biased. Berenger is another one for whom it\u0027s hard to think of a higher point reached than when he did this film. He is brutal and ruthless but he makes us support him in a strange way. The support cast are all good and contains a few famous faces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man show.\n\nOverall this is brutal and violent with no happy ending. At the end of the day isn\u0027t that what a war film should be?",

      "reviewBody": "From its opening, seemingly random B\u0026W images, Ingmar Bergman\u0027s \"Persona\" screams intellectualism. The film is cold, clinical, and abstract. It induces deep, philosophical questions that lack answers, or questions that provide for a multiplicity of emotionally unsatisfying answers.\n\nAbout eight minutes into the film, the story begins. In a hospital, young Nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is assigned to care for Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann), an actress who, for no apparent reason, has ceased speaking. Concluding that there is nothing physically or mentally wrong with Elisabeth, the hospital exports her to a seaside cottage, where she is to be cared for by Nurse Alma. Most of the rest of the film is set at the cottage, where the two women get to know each other. But throughout, Elisabeth does not speak. She communicates only with facial expressions and body gestures.\n\nFor all of Elisabeth\u0027s silence, the film\u0027s script is remarkably talky. Nurse Alma talks in long monologues: asking, probing, recalling. She tries to build a relationship with Elisabeth, by vocalizing her own memories and emotional pains in life. Certainly, the film\u0027s curious narrative has a lot to \"say\" about the art, or rather the artificiality, of human communication.\n\nThe best element of the film is the artistic, B\u0026W cinematography by Sven Nykvist. Lighting trends toward high contrast, with stark boundaries between light and darkness, a feature that contributes to the film\u0027s cold, intellectual tone. There are lots of close-up shots, even extreme close-ups, of the two women. The film\u0027s production design is ascetic, unadorned, austere. And this, too, enhances the analytic, abstract feel of the film.\n\nBergman conceived \"Persona\" while he was confined to a hospital. And I am inclined to think that the film is a cinematic expression of his own inward psychological struggles during that period of his life.\n\nIn other words, \"Persona\" communicates to us as much about Bergman\u0027s mindset, and his ideas of suffering and reality, as it does about any deep, universal questions in a post-modern world, although to some extent, the two dimensions intersect and overlap. Bergman is telling us that, ultimately, the film is not real. It is \"nothing\". It is an artificial human construct. That is, it is art, a perception that approximates, but does not replace, what we experience as reality.",

      "name": "The best classic spaghetti western in the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood trilogy!",
      "reviewBody": "For a Few Dollars More (1965) is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite personal classic western flicks ever! It is my third favorite in \"The Man with No Name\" Trilogy. I grew up watching this film and it was the first Clint Eastwood western movie I ever saw, I fall immediately in love with it and I just love this movie. It is Sergio Leone\u0027s best western film of all time my favorite. It is entraining and brilliant western flick with a great original epic story, great cast and the acting is fantastic. You have a great shoot outs, the music score is original epic. I always enjoy this film. It is my favorite Eastwood western movie. \n\nIn my opinion It is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood\u0027s classic film that they ever made together. Westerns like this film doesn\u0027t exit this days anymore. I have enjoyed For a Few Dollars More a lot. I love this one to death. The film is very entertained, is not boring and It has a good plot and story to tell. The characters, the action shooting sequences are just amazing and awesome. Sergio Leone does what he wanted to do with the film, and become one of the greatest epic classic western movies. I love this movie to death and it is my favorite film! There are other western films that Clint Eastwood made and directed but this one will be one of his best films in the history ever.\n\nThe first film was more about one hero but in this film there are two heroes. The bullets, the shooting is outstanding. The gun fights are awesome. This is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert, For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera.\n\nThe film is intelligent when Col. Douglas Mortimer suggested that the way to break the gang will be easy with one man from the inside of the gang (Monco) , because his younger. The story telling from El Indio about a carpenter who made a big closet were the safe was hiding in it was just plain brilliant.Monco breaks one of Indio\u0027s friends out of prison and is admitted to the gang, to prove his loyalty was awesome. The watch that Indio opens during the gun fight scenes and when the song stops by the watch he draw his gun and shoot anyone in the gun fight with him that was so awesome. The last showdown between Col. Douglas Mortimer and El Indio when the song stopped was TERRIFIC!\n\nWhy I love this movie? Simply because of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. I love Lee Van Cleef so much in here because he plays the good guy, he kills bunch of outlaws whit his riffle. He befriends Monco and he kills El Inido on the end. He doesn\u0027t split the reward with Monco , but he lets him have it, the money on a honest way. Clint Eastwood as Monco did a fantastic job in one of his best performances as Bounty Killer Monco. He also kills bunch of outlaws, he also shoot Mortimer\u0027s hat, he never shoots an Innocent or unarmed person, that is why I love this actor and his character so much. Gian Maria Volonté did a good job on another style he also never shoot unarmed person, he only did that once for a women he fall in love. Mortimer\u0027s sister, on the end of the film it was reveled why Col. Douglas Mortimer was hunting El Indio and his gang. He was doing it for both: Justice and Revenge, while Monco just wanted to get money and become rich, but he changed his mind after he saw how Indio is evil and cruel person. The gun fight between Col. Douglas Mortimer and Juan Wild - The Hunchback ( Klaus Kinski) in the bar was fantastic! How Col. Douglas Mortimer killed him. I love this film to death I love it! Sergio Leone did a fantastic job directing this awesome flick in fact I think it is his masterpiece. The film that changed the western movies today and I love the music score from Ennio Morricone. The dialogue and the script was amazing, the weapons used in this film are awesome and they are used well. Action is plenty in the film.\n\nWhat else do you want in an spaghetti Western film like this at all?! The fact is this is the greatest western ever made in the history. I love this film to death! It is my third favorite film in the Dollars trilogy. This movie is a perfect 10 it is my personal favorite western movie.",

      "reviewBody": "Although Kubrick\u0027s films are marked by their massive variation of genre and tone, one theme that crops up again and again is a strong anti-war sentiment, and this was never stated more strongly than in Paths of Glory. A relatively early Kubrick picture and, despite coming before what is considered his classic period, it is one of his best.\n\nIn contrast to his previous picture, The Killing, a definite Kubrick style is beginning to emerge now. One notable example is the scene in which General Mireau tours the trenches, walking towards the audience with the camera retreating away from him. This technique would be repeated years later in Kubrick\u0027s other war film, Full Metal Jacket. There is also something about the arrangement of objects in the frame, as well the tracking and dollying which hints towards his more familiar later style. His recurring chess motif appears as well, albeit subtly. At the court martial the floor is chequered, and the soldiers on trial are seated with guards standing behind them as if they are pawns about to be sacrificed.\n\nThe light and contrast in this picture is put to good effect. The palatial officers\u0027 headquarters is light and airy with few shadows. The trenches are gloomy and cramped. Kubrick was becoming a real master at contrasting locations and getting the look of a place just right.\n\nThe use of music in Paths of Glory is bold and brilliant. The pre-recorded score is almost entirely percussive  all rhythmic sounds with no melody. A weird kettle drum track is used to help build tension in the night patrol scene, while in the climactic scene the funeral march drumming instills a sense of dread, further heightened by having the shots edited in time to the beat. In the emotional final scene we get the complete opposite  a beautiful vocal melody. This has all the more impact after hearing nothing but militaristic drums for the rest of the film.\n\nThe casting is absolutely flawless. While there are no big names apart from leading man Kirk Douglas and the now elderly Adolphe Menjou, there isn\u0027t a single weak performance. The despair and resentment of the condemned soldiers feels so absolutely real. In contrast the smugness and fake sympathy of the upper class officers is brilliantly portrayed.\n\nThroughout his career Kubrick never seemed to be particularly keen on blatantly emotional moments. Paths of Glory is the exception. The later scenes are incredibly poignant and moving, and the final moments in the soldier\u0027s bar are what makes it a masterpiece more than anything else  the icing on the cake. However it\u0027s quite probable that Kubrick regretted this as an overly sentimental approach, as woolly sentimentalism was a major gripe of his when he worked on Spartacus. Whatever the case, he certainly reined in the stirring stuff considerably after this, to the point where his later films became characterised by their understatement of emotions.",

      "name": "A European View Of America",
      "reviewBody": "At face value, the screen story, about a dysfunctional family, is weak. The plot is not really credible. The lead character (Travis) is an older man who in the first ten minutes of the film wonders alone in the desert like a horse with no name, seemingly suffering from severe trauma. But Travis\u0027 later behavior and the behavior of other characters in the film are not believable, given this opening gambit.\n\nHowever, if we discard our need to interpret behavior rationally, then the film works, either as a dream or, more generically, as a parable of modern day America, from the viewpoint of a European film director. The characters and their journey through the film\u0027s story are symbolic of American culture as a whole, with its ever-present loneliness, urban alienation, emotional separation, and general rootlessness.\n\nThe film\u0027s visuals and music combine to prop up the thin story, and give the film its enduring cultural theme. Cinematographer Robby Muller\u0027s images are stunning. His location shots both in the desert and in the urban jungle, using polarizing filters, are works of true photographic art. The images, with their florescent greens, reds, blues, and yellows in dim light are just terrific. More than any dialogue could, these visuals effectively convey the loneliness, alienation, and lost love that are so characteristically American. And Ry Cooder\u0027s simple but haunting Tex-Mex guitar sounds amplify this grim mood.\n\nThe film\u0027s main flaw is its length. With a runtime of 150 minutes, some parts of the film could have been edited out, without loss of the film\u0027s message.\n\n\"Paris, Texas\" is a memorable art house film about the modern American experience. Like other art house films, the story is not necessarily to be taken literally. Instead, the story provides narrative support for the visuals, the music, and other film elements, the combination of which imparts some broader or deeper social message than could be conveyed by story alone.",

      "reviewBody": "2 things: Aamir Khan, Rajkumar Hirani. Actually, one needs nothing more than this to go and watch the movie. Two of the finest people in their craft when join hands, you can expect nothing short of a BLOCKBUSTER, in every sense of the word. Saw this movie first day, first show and might I add the occupancy of the theater was about 60% for a 10:00 am show. That speaks for itself about the enthusiasm that people had about the movie. The year 2014 has surely ended with a SMASH HIT. I was disappointed with Aamir after Dhoom 3 and I guess I am not alone but this movie makes up for everything, every darn thing. It is not Aamir\u0027s best performance but would surely count as one of his best. What makes it so bloody brilliant is the story which takes some pretty serious subject matters and portrays them to the audience in a way that the audience can only laugh, and when in the serious scenes, they do not laugh, what they do is reflect over what happened and THINK and the obvious BRILLIANT direction by Rajkumar Hirani. This movie makes you THINK. PK caters to both the types of audiences, one who just want uninhibited CRAZINESS and just want to ENJOY their time while they watch a movie, and the other, who want the movie to make sense and make you think, they want to learn something from it. THIS MOVIE CATERS TO BOTH!! Sushant Singh Rajput was used adequately in the movie, some might feel his role was small but I don\u0027t think so. Sanjay Dutt does justice to his role too. Boman Irani had a small role, smaller than that of Sanjay Dutt\u0027s. Anushka Sharma was pretty okay. Nothing great or spectacular. Oh and, watch out for that SURPRISE at the end of the movie!! PLEASE GO AND WATCH, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!",

      "reviewBody": "Czech director Milos Forman seems to be obsessed with rebellious characters that don\u0027t like to go with the flow. Just think about Larry Flynt in \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" or Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest\" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.\n\nThe movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn\u0027t mean that the movie isn\u0027t filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a \u0027wonderful\u0027 ending which I\u0027m not going to spoil.\n\nYes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.\n\nReally one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet. His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends. His return is mysterious and he doesn\u0027t know why he has been summoned. His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.\n\nA three and a half hour movie may not be everyone\u0027s idea of fun. On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made\u0027. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong. The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion. Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories. As a story this is moving and involving. There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don\u0027t feel as lazy as they have in other films.\n\nNoodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle\u0027s past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done. The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake! This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is. The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.\n\nThe cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc. De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both. Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same. McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman\u0027 she looks the same as she was when she was young. Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature. Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film. Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job. There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.\n\nThe direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles\u0027 memories. The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone\u0027s score. It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra\u0027s theme\u0027 has become one of my favourite tunes. The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.\n\nAn excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film.",

      "reviewBody": "\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\" (Edmund Burke) The evil in 1954\u0027s \"On the Waterfront\" is the union bosses, brilliantly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and their thugs. They are allowed to do business because of the fright, intimidation, and passiveness of an entire group of longshoremen, who either work or don\u0027t while the big shots take kickbacks and steal from them. Then Joey Doyle, who had agreed to testify against the union bosses, is set up by a clueless Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and thrown off of a roof. His sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) is determined to find out what happened. But no one will talk. She shames Father Barry (Karl Malden) into taking more of an interest in what is happening on the docks, and he does. Still, no one\u0027s talking. Terry falls in love with Edie but still can\u0027t do the right thing. Another man is killed. When the killing finally affects Terry, he realizes something has to change.\n\n\"On the Waterfront\" is one of the most amazing films ever made, directed by the great Elia Kazan. There were three Oscar nominations (Malden, Cobb and Steiger) in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the film took home the top acting awards, Kazan as director, and best film, best screenplay, best editing, best cinematography, best art direction. There was a nomination for Leonard Bernstein\u0027s fantastic score, and it\u0027s difficult to understand how he could have lost the award. This is the only film for which he wrote incidental music. It is fantastic, particularly in the tender moments between Terry and Edie.\n\n\"On the Waterfront\" has the classic performance of Marlon Brando, a man who is loyal to his brother Charlie (Steiger) even though Charlie ruined Terry\u0027s fight career and now is part of the union corruption. Brando is sensational as a tortured young man (based on whistle-blower Anthony DiVincenzo) who knows what he should do, but the price is too high. It\u0027s his love of Edie that gives him a conscience. She\u0027s from another world and hasn\u0027t been jaded by life yet. It\u0027s impossible to believe that this role was offered to Grace Kelly, but it was. Why Kazan thought her cold beauty and finishing school accent would have fit into this scenario is beyond me. Saint is perfect - warm, strong, gentle and most importantly, comes off as the kind of girl who lives in a blue collar neighborhood.\n\nLee J. Cobb as Johnny Friendly (based on real-life mobster Albert Anastasia) gives a bombastic, violent, and scary performance; Karl Malden is letter-perfect as the priest who fights for Terry\u0027s soul; and Steiger is excellent as Charlie, a weak man who has taken advantage of his brother to feather his own nest. Karl Malden\u0027s character of Father Barry was based on the real-life \"waterfront priest,\" Father John M. Corridan, who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the west side of Manhattan. Father Corridan was interviewed by screenwriter Budd Schulberg.\n\nThe saddest thing in the film is the attitude of the young boy who helps Terry take care of Joey\u0027s pigeons. He\u0027s already been inculcated with the \"D\u0026D\" (deaf and dumb) policy of the longshoremen.\n\nThe cloudy, rich atmosphere of the story is captured by the Hoboken, New Jersey locations - although this is a fictionalized version of events on the New York waterfront.\n\nThe end of \"Raging Bull\" is a homage to \"On the Waterfront.\" The end of \"On the Waterfront\" will give you goosebumps.\n\nEvil only triumphs when good men do nothing. When those same men stand up for what they believe in, they show evil for what it really is - cheap, lousy, and dirty.",

It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice.

      "reviewBody": "Roger Thornhill is an advertising man. However when he is kidnapped it is clear that he has been mistaken for someone else. When he tries to find out what\u0027s going he is framed for murder and sets out on a cross country run to survive. Along the way he meets danger, adventure and beauty in the shape of the mysterious Eve Kendall. However when he finds the truth he is drawn towards a final showdown with the dangerous Vandamm.\n\nRightly regarded as a classic and can more than compete with today\u0027s thrillers that too often rely on special effects to make up for the lack of genuine suspense. Here the plot requires a great deal of faith, but it is brought off with such style and energy that it is totally absorbing. The action is great and the several main scenes have become part of popular culture and are regularly spoofed on TV etc. The romance works as well and Thornhill and Kendall exchange plenty of good scenes.\n\nThe dialogue is great and the direction is faultless from Hitchcock. Many thrillers run over 2 hours - but only the good ones can stand up to repeated viewings. Northwest can take back to back viewings it is so good. The plot may have been put together as shooting went (as was the case with at least\n\none key scene) but it all stands together well. The acting is also perfect, Grant\u0027s rebirth as a thriller man is brilliant and is one of Hitchcock\u0027s best everyman characters. Marie-Saint is yet another dangerous blonde but is very good. James `The Voice\u0027 Mason is excellent, while Landau adds great homosexual subtext to his character. The ever present Leo G Carroll IS Mr Waverly but is still enjoyable and even support roles like Landis as Thornhill\u0027s mother is perfection!\n\nOver 40 years on this film has barely dated. Hearing the music is enough to make me want to see it again, while the direction, set pieces, dialogue and performances are all pitch perfect. A wonderful thriller for young and old - no sex, no swearing, all thrills.",

William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.\n\nThe true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. \n\nThe cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.\n\nThis is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970\u0027s (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics.",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\", they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It\u0027s not quite on the level of \"It\u0027s a Wonderful Life\", but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.\n\nStewart\u0027s performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.\n\nThe secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart\u0027s troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation.",

      "reviewBody": "Monty Python will always be loved or hated depending on your personality. And this is Monty Python at its typical best. If you like daft jokes, killer fluffy animals, bad accents and intelligent discussions that will most likely go over your head the first time round, then you will love The Holy Grail.\n\nThe jokes vary from obvious visual puns (coconut halves to represent horses) and audio puns (\"I am Roger the Shrubber\") to more subtle and intelligent jokes (\"I thought we were an autonomous collective\" / the Witch-burning scene). The greatest thing about the Holy Grail is that there\u0027s something for everyone. No one is left out.\n\nWhat many don\u0027t realise is the sophisticated intelligence behind the jokes that many of later generations don\u0027t understand (back in the Life of Brian - Romani Ite Domun - which wouldn\u0027t have such impact on the youngsters who never had to suffer through Latin classes) such as the witch burning scene, where it was true that any means possible was used to warp the natural and legal laws to create the desired result i.e. one less warty woman in the village, and how the mish-mash of Celtic tribes were suddenly forced to become a diplomacy (\"Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!\"). It always reminds me of Blackadder - how so many great jokes were wasted by bad timing or bad judgement on the audience\u0027s vocabulary.\n\nAnd for those who can\u0027t keep up with historical jokes, there\u0027s the Black Knight, Tim, and Zoot to keep you occupied. They sure as hell make me laugh.\n\nSo if you like daft humour, go for it! But promise to check out the subtle jokes as well. It\u0027s worth the effort, and you\u0027ll learn a little about history too.",

      "reviewBody": "Until now I couldn\u0027t bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation. All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (\"Antz\", \"Shrek\", \"Final Fantasy\"), and even the single unqualified success (\"Toy Story 2\") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could. \"Toy Story 2\" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in \"Tarzan\" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match \"Fantasia\" or \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". And I thought that \"Toy Story 2\" was as good as the art was ever going to get.\n\nI was wrong. This is far better. And what\u0027s more, there\u0027s no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow. It\u0027s now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I\u0027m hopeful. What we have here is computer animation\u0027s first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.\n\nIt\u0027s not fair to judge anything good as \"Monsters, Inc.\" as though it were a children\u0027s movie, but I can\u0027t resist comparing it with \"Shrek\" - which emphatically IS a children\u0027s movie. \"Monsters, inc.\" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way. The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children\u0027s screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls \"Boo\") into the city. But we never see things from her point of view. We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species. And they ARE. To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship). This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.\n\n\"Shrek\", of course, is a children\u0027s movie through and through. Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes. \"Monsters, Inc.\" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children. This is not to say children won\u0027t like it. Maybe they will. (Who can say?) Here\u0027s the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike \"Shrek\") actually have a beneficial effect. It will make them less frightened of the dark.",

      "reviewBody": "Studio Ghibli has been Japan\u0027s leading anime Production Company since the 1980\u0027s, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film \"Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind\" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic \"Princess Mononoke\".\n\nThe film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe\u0027s wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka\u0027s efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side\u0027s bid for allegiance.\n\n\"Princess Mononoke\" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki\u0027s best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, \"Mononoke\" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters\u0027 nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli\u0027s other works, which were aimed mostly at children.\n\nOf course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film\u0027s wonder, because Miyazaki\u0027s true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of \"Princess Mononoke\" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi\u0027s music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.\n\nOverwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg\u0027s \"E.T.\", \"Princess Mononoke\" became Japan\u0027s No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",

When it\u0027s over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into 85 minutes, it is incredible - the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the \"nose powder\"; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance (my favourite); the gibberish song - and many more. Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques, making the best of both worlds, not falling between stools as some directors might have done.\n\nOf course, there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances, of bureaucracy, and of the then current depression, on the ordinary \"little man\". And it is the little man, the individual caught up in society\u0027s complex machinery, whom Chaplin championed. He may have sympathised with left-wing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people, but Chaplin\u0027s essential beliefs are enshrined in the final \"words\" and shot, with him telling Paulette Godard, that she should keep smiling, they will get along, as they walk, a couple of individuals, into an uncertain future. Beyond politics, the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive.",

As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. \u0027Million Dollar Baby\u0027 is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!\n\nAbout a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. \u0027Million Dollar Baby\u0027 begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn\u0027t imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner! \n\nEastwood\u0027s understanding to the subject is objective and that\u0027s biggest plus point. Tom Stern\u0027s Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox\u0027s editing is razor-sharp.\n\nIn the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood\u0027s performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F. O\u0027Byrne is passable.\n\nOn the whole, the list of accolades this 2004 flick received is truly unprecedented. It\u0027s got a legendary tag. From this writer, Thumbs Up!",

      "reviewBody": "Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made. Its scope, its reach, its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by today\u0027s standards of film-making. Seen in context of its premier in 1927, Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history. Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great, and in particular, Metropolis. A great film is one that stirs the imagination, leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever, forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life, and achieves a kind of immortality. Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria. Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings, halluciatory scenes, and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope, most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions. There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria. Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual, as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups. Lastly, Metropolis has stood the test of time. It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre. The story itself is simple,a Biblical allegory, about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen. The film is anything but simple. It is immense, and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us.",

Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating \"Memento\" AGAIN. Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.\n\nThis is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out. And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading \"Memento Mori\", the short story upon which the movie is \"based\" helped, too.\n\n\"Memento\" is nothing short of a phenomenon.

      "reviewBody": "An action essential through and through, it\u0027s plain and simple! Since the days of \u0027Die Hard\u0027 and \u0027Terminator\u0027, the action genre has turned into a repetitive, over-the-top array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of CGI, of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of \u0027Casino Royale\u0027 and \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027, but certain directors *cough* Michael Bay... don\u0027t seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and over-the-top shaky camera-work among other things... oh but then there\u0027s \u0027Mad Max: Fury Road\u0027, talk about epic action pieces. It has been 30 years since the release of \u0027Beyond Thunderdome\u0027 back in 1985, and George Miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a Mad Max reboot, and my God, he truly is a mastermind of action. After creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of \u0027Mad Max: The Road Warrior\u0027 it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise, but Miller didn\u0027t just do that, he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films. With Tom Hardy as the new face of Max and Namibia as the new backdrop for post- apocalyptic Australia, \u0027Fury Road\u0027 is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made. Hearing that nearly 90% of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away, the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen. George Miller\u0027s 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite Australia\u0027s greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre.",

      "reviewBody": "And in the 1979th year of Our Lord, God took in a screening of Monty Python\u0027s \"Life Of Brian,\" and thought it was funny. \n\nHe did NOT think the film was blasphemous or offensive in any way. Yea, God did admire it\u0027s incredibly clever pokes at religion and at religious fanatics, for God Himself knew the virtue of being able to laugh at one\u0027s self. He also knew before He even walked into the theater that the title character, Brian, was NOT Jesus Christ, but merely a man who was born at the same time as Christ---right next door, in fact---and became mistaken for a messiah. God settled into His seat, with popcorn in one hand and diet soda in another, and had a rollicking good time.\n\nHe recommended \"Life Of Brian\" to His Son, Jesus, who went to see it the following week. He, too, thought it was a hilarious film, and immediately sang the praises of the Monty Python troupe---John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam \u0026 Michael Palin---for creating such a wonderful spoof. And He recommended the film to His friends. Have an open mind, He told them, and have fun. \n\nBut God and His Son were quite puzzled why so many people in the Bible Belt community were so upset by \"Life Of Brian\"---especially the ones who hadn\u0027t even bothered to SEE the frigging film for fear of being damned for all time. And They both shook their heads in dismay. It\u0027s only a movie, They thought, and a very funny, harmless one at that. Get a life!\n\nBut God gave Monty Python\u0027s \"Life Of Brian\" the power to overcome such ridiculous adversity, and today, well over two decades later, the film is rightfully regarded as a comedy classic, and one of the Python\u0027s finest works. It\u0027s *still* not a film for everybody, but does it have to be? If you\u0027re in tune with the Python\u0027s style of zany comedy, you\u0027ll enjoy \"Life Of Brian.\"\n\nAnd praise be to Saint George Harrison, late of The Beatles, for lending the Pythons a hand in making this wonderful movie. :-)",

      "name": "Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion\u0027s New DVD Package",
      "reviewBody": "As the seminal work of the French New Wave, the 1959 directorial debut of 27-year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However, the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It\u0027s worth seeing twice - once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut\u0027s childhood friend Robert Lachenay (the true-life inspiration for Rene in the film). Speaking in French but subtitled in English, he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison, listen to the by-the-numbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill (recorded back in 1992), which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.\n\nThe film\u0027s title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into \"raising hell\", an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteen-year old hellion named Antoine, living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin\u0027s life as he lies to people in authority - his parents, his teachers, and the police - since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn\u0027t make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine\u0027s life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut\u0027s immense credit, the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation, and he finds the ideal Antoine in Jean-Pierre Leaud, who brings out the confusion, angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes, yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible, often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.\n\nThere are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut, the first a year after the film\u0027s release discussing he film\u0027s impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twenty-year old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan (who has a minor role as a schoolmate) is amusing for his Satchmo-inspired rendition of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island\u0027s Tattoo, Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat, but Truffaut\u0027s emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker, even at this stage of his career, make this essential viewing.",

      "name": "Macho naturalism extraordinaire",
      "reviewBody": "This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let\u0027s allow a little license. And the title doesn\u0027t entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.\n\nThis is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you\u0027ve ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.\n\nYves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.\n\nThis is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There\u0027s a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930\u0027s. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet\u0027s direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.\n\nClouzet\u0027s wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.\n\nNo student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. \"La salaire de la peur\" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.\n\n(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\u0027t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

      "reviewBody": "Short analysis on Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u0027s Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain\n\nFor 20 years Jean-Pierre Jeunet collected small astonishing and intriguing moments in his life, taking notes in his diary, not knowing that he was up to co-write and direct one of the most successful film in French film history. Jean-Pierre Jeunet fell in love with the story and the film he titled Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain. But it\u0027s popularity was even a surprise to Jean-Pierre Jeunet himself as he once stated: `I guess I have to produce a film like Alien Resurrection (USA 1997) to make a movie like Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain\u0027, obviously not aware of the films potential. Unfortunately the film didn\u0027t win an Academy Award for the best foreign film in 2001 which still puzzles film fans all over the world.\n\nI consider Jean-Pierre Jeunet\u0027s film as a masterpiece. In my opinion, it is an outstanding film in film history for its cinematography, the music, the story, but above all the overall atmosphere. Going to the cinema is like meditating. We sit for over one-hour and comfortable chair - our breath slows down and as the lights are switched off, we enter a dream world. We seek to escape our normal world just for a short period of time, to experience something totally different and yet, we want to find ourselves in this world. Thanks to Jean-Pierre Jeunet I had a wonderful dream, I will never forget.\n\nJean-Pierre Jeunet and his camera man, Bruno Delbonnel, wanted to make the film look like the Spanish painter did his artwork. To establish a dreamlike atmosphere they used mostly red and green, sometimes adding a little blue spot in the picture to set the contrast. Audrey Tautou (Amélie Poulain), mostly wears either red or green dresses, as well as the housekeeper (Yolande Moreau as Madelaine Wallace, concierge), and Amélie\u0027s mother (Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulin) in the beginning of the film. When Amélie Poulain sits down to watch the tragedy of her life on her TV, there is an outstanding of a blue lamp in the background. Sometimes the use of color gets very obvious. Amélie\u0027s apartment for example is almost completely red, the underground station and the train station are kept in green and the green grocery store stands out from the grey buildings. Honestly, I haven\u0027t noticed the extreme use of color the first time I watched the movie. I just wondered how Jeunet succeeded in establishing such a fabulous atmosphere.\n\nThe atmosphere is also supported by the magnificent music by Yann Tiersen who has composed 19 songs in 15 days for this movie. The principal motive appears in many variations somehow being joyful, yet at the same time sad - slow and sometimes fast and activating. The music supports every moment in the film and becomes the sound of a fabulous world.\n\nCamera movement certainly contributes its part to the atmosphere. Balanced and unbalanced pictures contribute to the message of each shot. Right in the beginning when Amélie\u0027s mother is introduced, the picture is balanced symbolizing her pursuit for correctness and cleanliness. The same can be about the first shots of Amélie\u0027s father. When talking about his dislikes, the shots are unbalanced. But more impressing are some camera movements. For example there is an astonishing high angle shot of Amélie flipping stones on le canal in Paris. The camera shows her leaning on a fence, flying above her head then craning to a low angle shot to show her flipping stones in the direction of the camera. Another one worth mentioning might be the chase of the repairs person. Nino is shown falling up the steps chasing the repairs person for the photo machines. The camera turns to show the man getting in the car driving off. Still in a low angle Nino starts his moped, trying to follow the worker, almost hitting a car. Amélie is entering the picture running after Nino. The camera follows her, then turning almost 180° around her to show her hold Nino\u0027s red bag that he lost. When Amélie sits in front of the station, we see her in a long shot, the camera dollies in to fly over her head to an over-the-shoulder shot. Some of these camera movements are really awesome, not only from a technical point of view, but moreover from an aesthetic standpoint. They support the dreamlike atmosphere, adding interesting aspects to ordinary actions.\n\nAudrey Tautou at the age of 23 is an astonishing actress. I really can\u0027t imagine anybody doing the job better than she did. To me she is not only giving life to the character, she lives it. It\u0027s wonderful to watch her. There was no moment when I had the faintest impression that there is something wrong or inappropriate in her acting. Also Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is extraordinarily gifted with his talent. Most of the actors have done a wonderful job, although I want to mention the scene when Amélie\u0027s mother gets her nervous breakdown because of the suicidal fish. This scene appeared to me exaggerated which it probably was intended to be. Anyhow, the extreme close-up of Yolande Moreau was to intriguing to me, so I shrug back in disgust rather than laughing about it. I gues this was the director\u0027s choice, so I don\u0027t hold her responsible for that.\n\n Another negative and distracting thing where some scenes when Jean-Pierre Jeunet decided to show the key in Amélie\u0027s pocket after copying it and bringing the original key back to the grocer\u0027s door in a very unrealistic way. He uses a digital effet showing the key\u0027s silhouette in a yellow light. This is a technique that hasn\u0027t been used very often in the film, except for showing Amélie\u0027s heart going faster and the old, blind man feeling very happy after being guided by Amélie. All these scenes disturb the otherwise wonderful cinematography. There could have been other ways to communicate the actions. A simple smile on the old\u0027s man face, a close-up of Amélie\u0027s hand letting the copied key slide into her pocket and the heart beat as a background sound would have done the same without disturbing the atmosphere.\n\n Anyway, Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain is still my favorite movie. The narration is perfectly arranged taking its time to tell every detail. I enjoyed the subplots a lot that are told in a subtle way. Maybe the introduction is a bit to long, but still I enjoyed every second. Maybe I am too used to typical Hollywood productions, where you can tell the stages of a story by watching the clock. Le fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain has its own rhythm driving the story forward not by a superhero trying to achieve his goal, but by a hero that knows that she has time to arrange everything by strategic means. Maybe that is also one reason why I like this film so much. The story is told with time and not against time. There is no last minute-rescue, no time pressure, no need to act. It just takes its time as life does.\n\nIn my opinion, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece. A film that is not only outstanding because of the cinematography, the special effects or any other technical characteristics, but also combines the perfection of craftsmanship with a wonderful story, humour, and emotion.",

      "reviewBody": "Every once in a while there is a film that will blow you away from start to finish, in this case Lawrence of Arabia ins one of those very few films that will blow you away. For many years my grandfather enjoyed this film and suggested it to me for some time, finally being old enough to see it, I see why he and many others have enjoyed it. Epics are a kind of film that take an immense approach towards a story that needs a massive vision in order to tell such a story. David Lean took this massive vision in order to create something of epic scale and scope, which captured the extensiveness of an epic-genre film. Like most other epics, they take a great amount of time to tell their long stories, some ranging between three to five hours long which I will say may be too long for any kind of film. Lawrence of Arabia runs in at three hours and thirty-six minutes would seem like a rather long film, but this runtime feels appropriate when telling the progressional story of T.E. Lawrence building his character in great depth. Think of it like breaking the character of T.E. Lawrence into several parts such as a man, soldier, hero, leader, and advisor. In regards to the performances, Peter O\u0027Toole brings T.E. Lawrence to life on multiple levels making us feel for his life journey and all other circumstances that he faces on that journey. All supporting and secondary performances adds a lot of good flare as well, especially from Omar Sharif\u0027s character. The direction by David Lean resonates every minute of this epic, Lean took such great care in creating a film of scale, meaning making this film both look and feel immense. Great utilization of wide lenses and shots allow the look of the film to larger than life, which in turn makes those particular shots more impactful.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone, even if it were just one time. This film has been on many \"top films or greatest films of all times\", after seeing it I feel that this film justifies its placement on those lists. Overall Star Rating: 8.4/10",

      "reviewBody": "Sony Entertainment\u0027s Lagaan is more an experience than a movie.\n\nIndian actor Aamir Khan\u0027s home production is a cinematic experience which highlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner during the time of the British Empire\u0027s presence which deals with Lagaan (the tax of the land) and a village\u0027s upheaval against its oppressors.\n\nThe film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), Gauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel Shelley), and deals with Bhuvan\u0027s spirited fight to defend what is his birthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems which inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under which they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands behind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is the beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who aids the village in their fight against injustice.\n\nThe first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is, introducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this period and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through cinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the standard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the villagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second presents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you away in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.\n\nThe opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as from the moment you are thrust into 1893\u0027s India, you gain footing and a sense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting for the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for the duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its characters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are established, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each scene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos motion.\n\nThe second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more towards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time you are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been stirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine the entire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.\n\nThe romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly handled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the end of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies eternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a comparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A delightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the foundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in the viewer\u0027s heart.\n\nAamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction and fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he calls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become Bhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan\u0027s psyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his demeanour alone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through the camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience, drawing them more and more deeper into his world.\n\nGracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as particularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri completely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.\n\nRachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from looking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and style. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is delicately handled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley\u0027s in the same frame as the villagers without making one or the other look considerably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But the cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters come alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are intricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O Rey Chori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian cinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing unnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought and the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke discussion on how beautifully it has been shot.\n\nAndrew Russell\u0027s boisterous character is brought to life by Paul Blackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that should reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well and bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble of supporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav, who dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and convincingly with edge.\n\nA R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian films, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a modern day Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first resonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and burst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your heartbeat. It\u0027s lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros mesmerise and reflect the movie\u0027s emotions and spirit of hope. The songs are very well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan Ghanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly lit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles\u0027 flickering flames hypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.\n\nThe film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is superb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together by Aamir\u0027s awe-inspiring performance.\n\nLagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit and about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a piece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your heart.\n\nFuad Omar.",

      "reviewBody": "It is post-war Rome and much of the city\u0027s residents are impoverished and desperate for work. One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family. Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief\u0027, Vittorio de Sica\u0027s gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work. \n\nde Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs. The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true. The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again. \n\n`The Bicycle Thief\u0027 personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life. While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important. `The Bicycle Thief\u0027 has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.\n\n--Shelly",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies that have a lasting effect on you. After watching it, I found that it has less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the human feelings and the beautiful relationship of a father and his son. The holocaust provides the ultimate context, that brings and highlights the story and adds yet another deep dimension to the movie. No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie is not its strong point, but then again it is not supposed to be; this helps in bringing the audiences to a state of mind away from reality, focusing on the feelings generated by forgetting about all external events and developments of the war. Despite that, the movie does not fail to point out an element of the nazi psychology demonstrated by the doctor who was obsessed with riddles. This portrayed the nazi \u0027state of mind\u0027 (if ever such an expression existed) as a sick mentally disturbed state. Life is really beautiful as you watch Guido\u0027s relentless efforts to make a lovely exciting experience of the concentration camp to his son. You get exhausted just watching him going through his painful day and yet you smile as he speaks to his son and makes him laugh. One can go on forever describing the creativity of this movie, but one will not be able to capture all its beauty in writing.",

Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.\n\nMy eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",

      "reviewBody": "Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people\u0027 through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of Paris\n\nLa Haine (Hate\u0027) begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L\u0027Avenir c\u0027est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate\u0027s playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.\n\nThe quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz\u0027s script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us. Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood films\n\nLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the projects\u0027 in France, and all over the world. It doesn\u0027t offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .\n\nThe strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it\u0027s boring, and they despise the society that\u0027s created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film\u0027s other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.\n\nA criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don\u0027t help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.\n\nThis certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after  not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.",

      "reviewBody": "This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special. Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn\u0027t rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids\u0027 interest. It just tells a story.\n\nThe story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he\u0027ll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.\n\nThis is, in a way, Jesper\u0027s coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus\u0027 growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.\n\nApart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus\u0027 technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.\n\nKlaus isn\u0027t dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people. In Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.\n\nThe only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and Márgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can\u0027t really hold this against Klaus.\n\nSo, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks.",

      "reviewBody": "Winter Sleep is a masterpiece by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film shining with literary eloquence and incisive social criticism. \n\nAydin (\"intellectual\" in Turkish) is a failed former actor, now a hotel owner with sufficient inheritance to make him command the stage as a condescending \"king\" of a village in Cappadocia. He feels licensed to instruct, intrude and judge, not only on his pitiable tenants, but also on his disaffected young wife Nihal and divorced self-doubting sister Necla. This sentiment ostensibly extends to poor, uneducated and religious classes of the country, making Aydin a stereotype of the Turkish elite. The brutal taming of the horse is an allegory of his marriage; young and pretty Nihal is just another decorative item in his life, not an individual with her own rights and pursuits. Aydin also epitomizes a male-dominated society, cutting across levels of education and affluence. \n\nA glimmer of hope comes with a stone breaking the glass. While ruthlessly and decisively able to overpower everyone else in his reign, Aydin is disturbingly challenged by a stubborn 10 year-old boy Ilyas (Arabic equivalent of Elijah, a harbinger of the Messiah). \n\nPutting the lens on the perpetually pretending psyche of the western-styled intellectual, Winter Sleep portrays the Turkish nation struggling between the East and the West. Aydin claims to have ideals and ideas but has no intention to make a difference for the good, does not even attempt to empathize with his fellow citizens. His articulate quote from Shakespeare echoes a confession. \n\nIt\u0027s no coincidence that Nuri Bilge Ceylan was charmed by Chekhov, a like-minded author from yet another nation torn between civilizations. \n\nHats off to 2014 Palme d\u0027Or judges for their audacity. By recognizing the value of Ceylan\u0027s work, they have enticed global audiences to risk 3 hours 16 minutes of their time to a non-commercial film, a feast of cinematography and acting bundled with literary gratification.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure it\u0027s outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino\u0027s movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker? Of course not! Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the \u002760s and \u002770s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It\u0027s impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.\u0027 iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie\u0027 blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride\u0027s gory face as she\u0027s introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride \u0027Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai\u0027 - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\n\nThis film\u0027s a sampling of the Tarantino \u0027fury,\u0027 short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It\u0027s almost as if I\u0027m watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that\u0027s displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It\u0027s examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite \u0027old-school\u0027 filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there\u0027s a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\n\n Even at \u0027The House Of Blue Leaves\u0027, we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill\u0027s DVAS members.\u0027 My adrenaline\u0027s still flowing as I\u0027m recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Interesting characters. Action, adventure, and above all feeling, the mood just sucks me in and holds on till the very end and beyond. The music is epic, and the animation is top class. The setting is a futuristic kind of midevil inspired fantasy... if that says anything... but anyway it feels very real although fantastic and apeals to me. This movie is from the very heart of Hayao Miyazaki, the master of anime... Its so sad that the dubbed version was so butchered, it was the first version I saw(actualy the swedish dubbing of the american dubbing(sigh)) and I thaught it was great, but now that I have seen the original, a new door has opened and revealed a true masterpiece. I recomend this film to all and everyone. Average 10(10)",

Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (\"I threw up.\" \"Well that\u0027s ok! That happens sometimes\"-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. As a classic worldwide, it\u0027s no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.",

      "name": "Revelation of Horror",
      "reviewBody": "This is a fine film by a fine director, but I can only hope that Stanley Kramer, in committing to full length film a television story, knew at heart the message his movie was trying to say. Because this is truly a message movie, for all mankind, but if the reviews I\u0027ve read on this site are any indication, the message has been lost to some degree.\n\nI\u0027ve entitled my review \"Revelation of Horror\", but the horror revealed was not the Holocaust. That had already been revealed, although Kramer\u0027s film certainly lent its emotional impact. The revelation was a deep, true insight into how it happened, and the horror is that it happened in a civilized country. Few on this earth can imagine the true horror of Nazi Germany--I\u0027ve read criticism of Widmark\u0027s Colonel Lawson as too preachy, but the character and the acting conveyed the mission of one who actually saw the horrors, beyond any scope we can identify with.\n\nKramer\u0027s achievement is that everything in this movie reminds us that the Nazi\u0027s used every facet of civilization, no matter how minute, to foster their extermination of their enemies, to inculcate it as an ordinary part of life. That was why judges were chosen to portray the issue of \"obeying orders\" versus \"human decency.\" Herr Rolf is \"forced\" to defend the worst criminals imaginable, and yet his very defense and the principles behind it are abused in the process, used as a weapon against the very law they represent. Thus did the Nazis prevail with the willing acquiescence of the German people, and the abominable disregard of the rest of the world.\n\nThe other horror revealed in this film is the incessant excusing of it. Beyond the obvious pleas of the guilty (\"We didn\u0027t know\", or as one judge says to another, \"Was it possible to kill like that?\") are the multiplicity of subtle excuses: the reminder of centuries\u0027 old German culture, Rolf\u0027s plaintive cry of \"unfairness\" at the showing of the death camp films because of their inflammatory nature, the invocation of \"Lili Marlene\" throughout the film, to name just a few. While the song evokes sadness, a guilty German society meant for it to invoke sadness. Long before Germany had its country destroyed by bombs, it had its soul destroyed by Hitler.\n\nBecause this is a courtroom drama, respecting the sacred role of the Rule of Law in safeguarding humanity, almost every scene, every line is a statement that Nazi Germany perverted the Rule of Law, as did the very defense of the war criminals. But what is principle on a small scale of a single man being judged by society becomes outrage when used to defend the indefensible on an impossibly massive scale. Tracy\u0027s character at the film\u0027s end has a realization that this is so, as well as an awareness that what happened in Germany during the Third Reich was an Aristotelian tragedy for anyone touched by it, even remotely, so that any personal considerations (such as Mrs. Berthold) are made utterly impossible.\n\nRolf\u0027s speech about the guilty responsibility of the rest of the world was valid--but he was indicting the world to save one man. Where have we heard that in our own time? This quality about \"Judgment at Nuremburg\" makes its message forever fresh--and its warnings.",

I hadn\u0027t been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.\n\nI\u0027m mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see \"A Separation\". I will be shocked if this movie doesn\u0027t win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I\u0027ve seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi\u0027s story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.\n\nIf this movie reminds me of anything, it is \"Ladri di Biciclette\" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly \"simple\" story setup. But then \"A Separation\" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it.",

      "reviewBody": "Consider this, \"It Happened One Night\" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930\u0027s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. \n\nThe main reason \"It Happened One Night\" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra\u0027s direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: \"That French broad likes money\" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.\n\nThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father\u0027s private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.\n\nWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: \"Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It\u0027s also clever, funny and a bit risqué (for 1934)\" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion\u0027s opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.\n\nAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.\n\nThen again, what do I know? I\u0027m only a child.",

      "reviewBody": "For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that\u0027s how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.\n\nSean Penn directed and Eddie Gautier was the Director Of Photography. I can\u0027t stand Penn as a person but fair-is-fair and I think he\u0027s great as a director, having seen his work in \"The Pledge\" and \"The Crossing Guard.\" The main actor, Emile Hirsch, who plays \"Chris McCandless\" (a.k.a. \"Alexander Supertramp\" reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio with his looks, build and voice inflection. He is very credible as the young guy who wants nothing to do with materialistic society and dreams of living in the wilds of Alaska. The problem was that he was unprepared and underestimated what he was up against.\n\nTwo people who fascinated me the most in here were two extremes, age-wise - Hal Holbrook and Kristen Stewart. It was really great to see the veteran Holbrook (\"Ron France\") again. He was about 82 when he made this film and hadn\u0027t acted in a film in a few years. He was terrific, too. He had some of the most memorable scenes in the story. Meanwhile, teenager Stewart was captivating as \"Tracy Tatro,\" who had a crush on \"Alex.\" This young woman is on her way to stardom.\n\nBrian Dierker and Catherine Keener also were really, really interesting as the aging hippie couple, \"Rainey\" and \"Jan.\" I kept thinking, I know this guy when listening to Dierker\u0027s voice, finally guessing it was Jeff Bridges underneath all the beard....but it Dierker, a guy who rarely acts in films.\n\nKnowing the book, the only part of the film that caught be off-guard was the young Swedish couple. I don\u0027t remember them in the book but I\u0027ll never forget this in this film!! One could debate the pros and cons of Chris McCandless for hours, so no sense going into that here. I thought the film was pretty kind to him. You read more in the book about how he hurt a lot of people with his silence. Either way, it\u0027s a a fascinating story and a beautiful film.",

      "reviewBody": "(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan\u0027s filmmaking style)\n\nThere have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it\u0027s not Christopher Nolan\u0027s best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i\u0027ll talk about Interstellar a bit.\n\nInterstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to \u00272001: A Space Odyssey\u0027 isn\u0027t just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick\u0027s vision of Arthur C. Clarke\u0027s sci-fi epic wasn\u0027t to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan\u0027s films). But it\u0027s so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it\u0027s tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they\u0027re on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film\u0027s bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom\u0027s work inspired the film\u0027s genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there\u0027s the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i\u0027ve ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.\n\nNow, about Mr. Nolan. Don\u0027t just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it\u0027s The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there\u0027s The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.\n\nThis is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can\u0027t deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can\u0027t wait to see what he does next, but i\u0027m not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.",

The silliness of the story is marvelously camouflaged with great dialogue and some superb performances. Christoph Waltz must be thinking already about his acceptance speech. What a performance! The civilized monster, polyglot, refined and deadly. He gets us going from the first, sensational scene. Brad Pitt is also wonderful. Was he putting a Mussolinni chin while impersonating (hilariously) an Italian? I thought so. His character\u0027s name sounds like Aldo Ray and I\u0027m sure that\u0027s no accident. The film is full of movie references. Another character is named Fenek, as an homage to his 1970\u0027s sexpot, Edwige Fenech. What is already one of Tarantino\u0027s trademarks is his sure step along the most immediately recognizable bits of pop culture. He\u0027s clearly not a cultured man but a pop expert, king in a world where people get their news from TV, don\u0027t read, other than magazines and comics, etc. That\u0027s how it happens, to be in the right place at the right time. For better or worse this are Tarantino times.",

      "reviewBody": "Indiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves.\n\nWe didn\u0027t know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be.\n\nIn 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn\u0027t have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).\n\nI mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore.\n\nIn comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture\u0027s trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It\u0027s this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn\u0027t up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.\n\nMade for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that\u0027s a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10",

      "name": "Not all the hype suggests but still an enjoyable action thriller built on a good concept and encourages thought afterwards",
      "reviewBody": "The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several \"levels\" at once, I still found it easy to follow.\n\nThe film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part – and not because I\u0027m smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don\u0027t lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too \"ordinary\" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don\u0027t make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.\n\nTo its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb\u0027s subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable \"baddie\" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that \"was the real level actually a dream\" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going \"or was it?\" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).\n\nThe cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to \"come in\" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of \"oh look its x\" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn\u0027t really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.\n\nI\u0027m not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn\u0027t – pay attention. Doesn\u0027t quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film.",

      "reviewBody": "Want to see where one of the modern era\u0027s hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.\n\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year\u0027s brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.\n\nAdapted from Wajdi Mouawad\u0027s play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we\u0027re drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.\n\nThere\u0027s not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve\u0027s deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.\n\nSaying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they\u0027ve never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.\n\nThe film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.\n\nFinal Say - \n\nFor any fans of Villeneuve\u0027s work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era\u0027s great filmmakers.\n\n5 swimming pools out of 5",

      "reviewBody": "Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film. Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it. Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in. Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it. This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best. Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn\u0027t want to grow up. He has had so many troubles at home his father\n\nGiuseppe played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.\n\nFrom there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other\u0027s feeling and face up to where they stand in the world. Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad. What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it\u0027s more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.\n\nOne film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.",

      "reviewBody": "After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.\n\nThat I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. \n\nThe setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law \u0026 order  all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns  the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists\u0027 white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.\n\nGood, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (\"Sentenza\") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (\"Blondie\") and Ugly (\"Tuco\") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they\u0027re not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled  in many ways similar to Sentenza  but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.\n\nGBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier\u0027s vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced  by Sentenza\u0027s orders  to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.\n\nThat was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I\u0027d ever heard  it\u0027s an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.\n\nThe plot was extremely clever  and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold  three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal\u0027s behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, \"Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I\u0027ve done.\" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:\n\n\"There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.\"\n\n\"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting.\" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: \n\n\"You see in this world there\u0027s two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.\" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film\u0027s climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.\n\nNot just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "Ikiru (\"to live\")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children\u0027s park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe\u0027s plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe\u0027s beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",

      "reviewBody": "Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don\u0027t need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers\u0027 comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most \"satisfying\". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn\u0027t really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it\u0027s only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn\u0027t always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. \n\nOn another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains \"propaganda\" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it\u0027s a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It\u0027s astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin \"was no better than Hitler\" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie\u0027s context - Klimov\u0027s picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it\u0027s about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I\u0027ve always believed there\u0027s something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me.",

It\u0027s just lovely, from the beginning to the end, I really laughed and I was anxious for the characters when they suffered (and I\u0027m 22). The film wasn\u0027t too long, it didn\u0027t have stupid lines whatsoever and it put to silence the annoying child behind me from the first five minutes or so, which I believe says it all.\n\nI don\u0027t know if I will actually go to the cinema but I definitely want to see it again. \n\nGreat special effects and, again, a very lovely dragon.",

It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.\n\n9 out of 10",

But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today. \"Heat\" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted. Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you\u0027ve lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart. When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again. I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own. The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen. The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering \"who could be so lucky to work with them?\". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) \"Heat\" grabs you and pulls you in. This is a true film masterpiece.",

The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It\u0027s more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.\n\nDeathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven\u0027t seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you\u0027ll be confused to death. Obvious isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.\n\nThe series doesn\u0027t only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It\u0027s a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince\u0027s Tale scene.\n\nNo need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.\n\nFor me it\u0027s really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I\u0027m not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you\u0027re a fan or not, you\u0027ll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.",

      "reviewBody": "Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.\n\nThe film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.\n\nBranded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.\n\nThe heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film\u0027s merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.\n\nThe most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film\u0027s Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero.",

      "reviewBody": "Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my \"People\u0027s Choice Award\" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar \"they-couldn\u0027t-have-been-more-different\" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as \"Dumb and Dumber To\" and \"The Three Stooges\" elicited a virtual double-take.\n\nBut I couldn\u0027t help it ... it really WAS the best film I saw (out of 17), and far and away the most entertaining. I think this is largely because it\u0027s based on a real-life story about the beginning of a lifelong friendship - a story that has writing participation by the son of one of the real-life characters. There\u0027s definitely an air of authenticity to the events as they unfold that could never occur with a purely contrived plot. Consider: A college-educated concert pianist of Jamaican descent hires a temporarily-unemployed Italian-American nightclub bouncer who\u0027s streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venues in the Deep South back in 1962. That\u0027s not a setup that a Hollywood script written from scratch would ever have come up with.\n\nThe two lead actors really click. Mahershala Ali makes a nice Oscar follow-up playing the aloof pianist passenger to Viggo Mortensen\u0027s \"b.s. artist\" driver. Ali is certain to get another nomination; Mortensen\u0027s performance may be a little too broad to garner one, but he delivers exactly what\u0027s called for. And he makes a believable Italian-American, which is impressive considering that he\u0027s Danish.\n\nI\u0027m allergic to preaching and heavy-handedness in movies no matter what the message, and with the exception of one borderline scene, I\u0027d say that the movie nicely sidesteps these proclivities that surface so often in socially-conscious films.\n\nThe music and FX are excellent. When an actor plays a piano player, there\u0027s always the challenge of making the playing look believable. It doesn\u0027t get any better than it gets here - Ali\u0027s piano playing is every bit as convincing as Margot Robbie\u0027s ice skating in I, TONYA. You never see a disconnect between hands and body as he\u0027s filmed against a variety of backgrounds. And if I could bet on an Oscar win right now, it would be Kris Bowers for Best Original Score. (He also supplies Ali\u0027s hands, which should clinch it.)\n\nTop everything off with a Capra-esque Christmas Eve finale and a closing line that sends everyone home smiling, and it all adds up to a monster hit. Its commercial payoff could be huge - the movie practically begs for a TV series spinoff, and the real-life characters remained friends until they both died in 2013.\n\nSo congratulations to Peter Farrelly on his graduation from co-directing lowbrow fare to solo-directing middlebrow (i.e. mass-appeal) fare. You can\u0027t deny the talent and craftsmanship it takes to make a mainstream movie that works as well as this one does.",

Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The \"olidish\" bitterness of Clint\u0027s character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now.",

      "reviewBody": "\u0027Goodfellas\u0027 is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it\u0027s all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it\u0027s really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he\u0027s ever been, and this is Joe Pesci\u0027s definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the \"stars\". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). \u0027Goodfellas\u0027 is (to date) Scorsese\u0027s last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",

The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn\u0027t even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.\n\nMatt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will\u0027s talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will\u0027s intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.\n\nYes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.\n\nThe writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt\u0027s best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet\u0027s Society.\n\nIf your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it\u0027s time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.\n\nThis one is a keeper in my movie library.",

Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, \"After all, tomorrow is another day.\"",

      "reviewBody": "I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. \n\nLike many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of \"whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator.\" \n\nThe theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn\u0027s screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.\n\nBen Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.\n\nFincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Gladiator\" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a \"complete\" movie.\n\nI am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less \"popular\" artists who also deserve a big \"bravo\". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.\n\nActually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... \n\nThe scenery used for \"Gladiator\" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.\n\n\"Gladiator\" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven\u0027t gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!",

Where the audience is made familiar with the characters which he \u0027wishes\u0027 to be.\n\nGangs Of Wasseypur Adopts a different Approach.It makes the Audience identify with reality and makes familiar with the characters that \u0027are\u0027 around him.\n\nBeing from wasseypur in dhanbad i was super excited to watch the movie based on my locality. i had presumed the movie might be \u0027inspired\u0027 by the gang wars, but no movie is 90% the actual story of the town.\n\nThe movie has penetrating dialogues, harsh naked truth characters and language. Manoj Bajpayee\u0027s acting was breath taking. the scenes are still vivid even after 2 days of watching the movie. His Chemistry with the character \u0027Durga\u0027 was awesome. \n\n\u0027sardar khan\u0027s interaction with ramadhir singh in the movie is very interesting. \n\nThe movie was brilliant in first half. The only place where the movie could improve is that there are so many characters that a normal audience will be confused and may just lose the plot. One needs to watch the movie carefully.\n\n9/10 to the movie made about my locality. Wasseypur Zindabad!",

The film is harsh and doesn\u0027t turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.",

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump\u0027s travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It\u0027s a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.\n\n I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That\u0027s usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I\u0027m allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they\u0027re not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that\u0027s important for a good comedy. And it\u0027s hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She\u0027s an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she\u0027s doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. \n\nMovies like this aren\u0027t just being made for children exclusive... They\u0027re good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you\u0027re 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",

      "reviewBody": "\"What\u0027d this guy look like anyway?\" \"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin\u0027.\" \"Uh-huh. In what way?\" \"Just a general way.\" In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen\u0027s finest film. Of course you can draw comparisons to others they\u0027ve made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers\u0027 takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard\u0027s stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson\u0027s confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn\u0027t imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, \"He\u0027s fleeing the interview!\" Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There\u0027s comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi\u0027s violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry\u0027s haplessly kidnapped wife. If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you\u0027ll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you.",

      "reviewBody": "I was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. And as I am huge fan of love, I bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre. After 90 minutes I left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film. I was appalled at the story itself, that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it. I just couldn\u0027t go passed the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I ran into it... I was in a different mood, no longer had any expectation ... and had more patience, more relaxed mind to \"see\" the film... and as soon as I opened my eyes, I discovered the love... the beauty of the film. I went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting (not even for a moment did I ever felt like they were acting!) and the cinematography. The first time I heard a definition of what a film is, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (shots) and this is the film to match the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music... and the light effects... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films.",

      "reviewBody": "Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.\n\nWell, if you\u0027re familiar with Kaufman\u0027s work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself \"What the hell is going on?\", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I\u0027m glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel\u0027s head.\n\nIf you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.\n\nBut if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that\u0027s beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he\u0027s smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman\u0027s writing is always clever, but this time he\u0027s one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but \u0027Eternal Sunshine\u0027 manages to dazzle you with it\u0027s originality and it\u0027s poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.\n\nMichel Gondry\u0027s use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. \n\nEternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of \"Best of 2004\".",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve seen this movie in the cinema ten years ago when I was younger and now, after seeing it again, I\u0027m surprised that I still get the same emotions from it. In my review, I\u0027ll try to stay away of spoilers but I\u0027ll also give you a good treatment of the plot as well (just the big-picture).\n\nMovie starts as Baran, an old eskiya (a honorable bandit) is getting out of prison after 35 years of jail to find his village and his home under the waters of Firat river. He then learns that his confinement was due to an old comrade\u0027s betrayal, and that his comrade took away and married his lover, Keje. Baran comes to the biggest city of Turkey, Istanbul to seek his old comrade and maybe to take revenge...\n\nDue to an unlikely coincidence, he meets Cumali, a young man that has no family and is living in Istanbul, earning his life with criminal acts. Baran the Eskiya is not familiar with the city-life but Cumali is willing to help him because of his debt.\n\nBaran the eskiya has a deep character, despite his criminal past, he looks like a naive person in the metropolitan city of Istanbul. Despite that he is an uneducated person, he may be the most honorable and wise person in this big city. Sener Sen (Baran) and Ugur Yucel (Cumali) each gives spectacular acting performance and their talents combined with an intelligent script breathe life into this \"Eskiya\" myth. Baran is the last of the Eskiyas !\n\nThe movie has a slow start but towards the ending, the mood gets stronger. The movie reaches it\u0027s climax at the dramatic scenes to the finish. This is a story about honor and the power of love. This is a story about two strangers that are becoming tied emotionally, like the father and the son. A classic Turkish Action/Drama movie for all to see ! \n\nPS. also check out another Turkish movie \"Kabadayi\" by the same director/writer (Yavuz Turgul) and the same actor (Sener Sen).",

In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",

      "reviewBody": "Everyone\u0027s been raving about this. My opinion doesn\u0027t differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I\u0027d developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole \"20min ovation at Cannes\" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it\u0027s an amazing work.\n\nSkipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I\u0027ll go straight to the tech specs. I\u0027m not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn\u0027t tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.\n\nSergi Lopez and Maribel Verdú really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven\u0027t seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia\u0027s closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.\n\nWhen the fairy tale elements return, it\u0027s astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.\n\nOne thing that most reviews haven\u0027t mentioned is the violence. I think it\u0027s been firmly established that this is an adult\u0027s fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don\u0027t seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.\n\nA final and obvious point I spose I can\u0027t get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That\u0027s all.\n\nI was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn\u0027t a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can\u0027t recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn\u0027t share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.\n\nI just wish I\u0027d seen it without already having read so much. I\u0027ve tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I\u0027d urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more.",

      "reviewBody": "Just came back from the Premier Screening of Drishyam. The reason for me to catch the movie was the reviews of the original Drishyam which is a Malyalam movie with Mohanlal as the lead actor. The trailers of this Hindi remake with powerful existence of Ajay Devgan (or Devgn, as he writes it now) and Tabu, motivated me to go for this movie after a tiring Thursday in office, (mentioning the tiring day as disappointment was the last this I was willing to accept after the day, Glad I chose this movie). So the movie starts with a small happy family of Vishal Salgaonkar which is living happily in the ever happy town of Goa, there family was disrupted because of an unwanted person entering into their lives who happens to be the son of the Inspector general of Goa, Meera Deshmukh, then an accident happens which changes the life of this family for ever. The way this 4th grade failed person (Vishal) plays with the police department is commendable. So the movie is about how actually Vishal safeguard his family and himself against powerful Meera and her Police Department.\n\nMy special suggestion is to have patience and sit for the first half of the movie as nothing much will happen but the story will be built up. After the interval when you come back with that tub of popcorn, its then the real investigation and the never ending plot of Vishal to safeguard his family starts, the proceedings will sometimes give you goose bumps and at times you will expect something to happen which will not happen and hence the tag line of the move \"Visuals Can Be Deceptive\" The Camera work of the movie is good. it features some of the beautiful locations of Goa (I am not sure if all of that was Goa) The acting done by the whole Salgaonkar family is superb along with Tabu\u0027s never disappointing appearance in front of the camera. The movie has limited songs, Two, actually, if I remember correctly, but both the tracks are good and perfectly goes with the situation. The side characters in the movie are also done by good actors and so they mix in the screenplay very meticulously. Overall, Its 100% worth a watch on this weekend, so go ahead book your tickets and go for it, I am sure you wont be disappointed, specially people who like Ajay Devgn on screen should go for this movie for sure.",

      "reviewBody": "Who\u0027d have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn\u0027t expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven\u0027t seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick\u0027s side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven\u0027t laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn\u0027t overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what\u0027s even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick\u0027s most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I\u0027m not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick\u0027s other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick\u0027s films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can\u0027t really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I\u0027ll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick\u0027s sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you\u0027re going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you\u0027ll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can\u0027t praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won\u0027t regret it. I know I didn\u0027t. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.\n\nFew movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it\u0027s a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as \"cheesy.\"\n\nI read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film\u0027s snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That\u0027s not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,\n\nFor a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.\n\nMacMurray\u0027s narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.\n\nStanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.\n\nThis film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, \"Body Heat,\" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one.",

      "reviewBody": "In Quentin Tarantino\u0027s Django Unchained, there is a scene in which Django (Jamie Fox), soon after being freed by the incredibly likable dentist turned bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), shops for new clothes to wear. \n\nSchultz tells Django to pick out whatever he likes. Django looks at the smiling white man in disbelief. You\u0027re gonna let me pick out my own clothes? Django can\u0027t believe it. The following shot delivered one of the biggest laughs from the audience I watched the film with. After the white man confirms that yes, he is indeed letting the black man pick out his own clothes, we cut to a wide shot of Django riding his horse, now decked out in his very own (outlandish) cowboy outfit—an all blue with white ruffle get-up. \n\nIt\u0027s a great little scene that provides humor and allows the viewer to further warm up to the two main protagonists. But it also does more than that. It\u0027s a simple scene that speaks for the whole film. It\u0027s an affirmation that this man of color is now free and able to make his own decisions. The choice he made concerning his extravagantly loud outfit acts as a warning to those that plan to stand in his way—watch out, here I come, I ain\u0027t gonna be quiet no more.\n\nAnd the humor the scene provides echoes the entire film—it wants us to get comfortable with our hero. Tarantino knows that a man of color makes an unconventional hero in a revenge- flick—that\u0027s why he made the film. When was the black man going to get his revenge film? It\u0027s been long overdue. With Django Unchained, that film has finally arrived and it has arrived in style. Beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and meticulously written, it\u0027s Tarantino at his most epic.",

And from the start it wasn\u0027t a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.\n\nVery interesting to see Powell\u0027s trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.\n\nMichael Kamen\u0027s upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky. Listen closely and see if you get reminded of \"Singing in the Rain\" or Beethoven\u0027s \"Symphony no. 9\" as the movie goes on.\n\nSome of the best lines ever... e.g. \"After all you speeches, you\u0027re nothing but a common thief\"... \"I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I\u0027m moving into kidnapping, you should be more polite\"\n\nGrade A+\n\n10/10",

      "name": "The perfect film for the perfect murder...",
      "reviewBody": "After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford\u0027s 1953 tale of romance and adventure, \"Mogambo\", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master\u0027s films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock\u0027s idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western \"High Noon\", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. \"Dial M for Murder\" was the first of Hitchcock\u0027s films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.\n\nThe movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony\u0027s plan\u0027s infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.\n\nLike most Hitchcock\u0027s films, \"Dial M for Murder\" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott\u0027s script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it\u0027s easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.\n\nIt seems that Hitchcock\u0027s knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock\u0027s classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock\u0027s use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott\u0027s dialog to shine.\n\nWithout disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly\u0027s talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming \"villian\". Milland\u0027s performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.\n\nIn many ways, \"Dial M for Murder\" shares many things with \"Rope\", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both \"experiments\": while \"Rope\" was conceived as a \"movie in one take\", \"Dial M for Murder\" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock\u0027s use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices\u0027 apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with \"stuff coming out of the screen\" (as seen in for example, \"House of Wax\"). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.\n\n\"Dial M for Murder\" is probably less celebrated than the Master\u0027s most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as \"Rear Window\" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Antonius Block - \"Who are you?\" Death - \"I am Death.\" Antonius Block - \"Have you come for me?\" Death - \"I have long walked by your side.\" Antonius Block - \"So I have noticed.\"\n\nThe Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman\u0027s greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman\u0027s films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.\n\nAs the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block\u0027s castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time.\n\nBrilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman\u0027s vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer\u0027s powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow\u0027s brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot\u0027s sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.\n\nA masterpiece!",

But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.\n\nI think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded (by hate for example), which should never be forgotten.\n\nIn a way, a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for, making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.\n\nIt was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure.",

      "reviewBody": "So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams\u0027 untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It\u0027s not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams\u0027 performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it\u0027s hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It\u0027s almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he\u0027s most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin\u0027s death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly \"moved\" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won\u0027t be sorry.",

      "reviewBody": "While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie, it is one of the very few that I own. Wolfgang Petersen\u0027s magnificent accomplishment in \"Das Boot\" is reiterating the dictum that \"war is hell\", no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located.\n\n*** Minor spoilers ***\n\nThe plot has been well described by other viewers so I won\u0027t rehash it again. But my personal observations, as an ex-submarine sailor, are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say \"probably\" because todays subs are hotels compared with the German U-boats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a \"sewer pipe\" for weeks at a time. More importantly, you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions (American WW2 subs used to be called \"pig boats\"), deals with an unfortunately believable political officer, deals with drills, actual torpedo firings, actual ships casualties, and deals, most frighteningly, with retribution from the \"enemy\". My own experience watching the depth charging of the U-boat was such that I was thinking \"stop it, Stop It, STOP IT, STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!!\" That\u0027s how real it felt to me. For the rest of you, I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 U-boat.\n\nThis movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew (and ultimately the sub) together. Petersen\u0027s direction for Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock was masterful because it didn\u0027t portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead, knows his submarine as if he were married to it (and in many ways he is) but isn\u0027t perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities, Captain Lehmann-Willenbrock can not do the job alone: he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs, but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookie-cutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.\n\nI could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot, direction, cinematography, acting, sound, music, editing all being top notch, this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles.\n\n------------------------------------ \n\nI believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine, specifically through the open watertight doors, without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was, I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.\n\n(It turns out I was wrong: \"Bound For Glory\" was the first.)\n\nEDIT (12 OCT, 2006): I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usage:\n\n\"Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano\u0027s design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability, a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale, so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up. Vacano wore full-body padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mock-up was rocked and shaken.\" \n\nSo, literally, a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of \"Das Boot\". However, a camera that resembled Steadicam in function (in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform) was used.\n\n------------------------------------ \n\nEven though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors, and we have refrigerators, freezers, air conditioning, are able to take showers, etc., there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on: the smell. While the smell of the \"pig boats\" of WW2 was truly atrocious, even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere, you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created, from burned toast in the galley, from the smell of the \"sanitary gasses\" (to be kind), to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel, all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You, as a sailor, may get used to it, but when you get home, your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!",

      "reviewBody": "I first saw \"Cool Hand Luke\" the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time, I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. \"Luke\" is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson\u0027s screenplay is nothing less than a working man\u0027s parable of a truly good soul who just couldn\u0027t seem to get a break. In ways, it could be said he truly didn\u0027t let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be, the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks, They knew They couldn\u0027t knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that, and it was an example I\u0027ve clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall\u0027s cinematography was breathtaking, providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast: Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Lou Antonio, Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. \"Dragline\". The most unforgettable \"gentle giant\" I believe I\u0027ve ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them, in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances, helped raise Paul Newman\u0027s masterful portrayal to an ever higher level, maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in \"Cool Hand Luke\" and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating, challenging, confusing, pain- in-the-ass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year, and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some world-shaking hope. Can\u0027t speak for anyone else, but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes, these are the two whose stories got me through some really, really bleak times. And for me, \"Cool Hand Luke\" was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him, all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn\u0027t worth his getting worked up over. Wasn\u0027t gonna get to his spirit.",

And that\u0027s good for all, since \u0027Coco\u0027 is all heart \u0026 soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.\n\n\u0027Coco\u0027 Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family\u0027s ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.\n\n\u0027Coco\u0027 captures the themes of Life \u0026 Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat \u0026 redemption also are explored here, but with humor \u0026 real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film\u0027s final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life \u0026 death true meaning.\n\n Adrian Molina \u0026 Matthew Aldrich\u0027s Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich\u0027s Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. \u0027Coco\u0027 unfolds gorgeously \u0026 not for a second, does the pace drop.\n\nVocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael García Bernal s Héctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel\u0027s idol \u0026 Ana Ofelia Murguía as Mamá Socorro \"Coco\" Rivera, Miguel\u0027s great-grandmother, stand out. And yes, this is a Film made in America about Mexicans \u0026 their tradition. Take That, Mr. President!\n\nOn the whole, \u0027Coco\u0027 deserves all your time \u0026 money. Don\u0027t Miss It.

      "reviewBody": "City Lights is probably one of the most well loved, along with Modern Times, Chaplin movies. The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.\n\nThe plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn\u0027t remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.\n\nCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It\u0027s poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone.",

      "reviewBody": "Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble. It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories. The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized. At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains. Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.\n\nAs the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity. Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death. The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently destructive of human values. Kane himself states `If I hadn\u0027t been born rich I might have been a really great man.\n\nWhat is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore). Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.\n\nOrson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man. This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar. Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time. He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.\n\nUnconstrained by Hollywood\u0027s traditions, he broke all the rules. The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations. A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another. Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.\n\nDespite the film\u0027s pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells\u0027 Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane\u0027s close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane\u0027s would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.\n\nSo many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it\u0027s characters is universal in it\u0027s compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.\n\nKane was one of the most controversial films ever made. Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film. When that didn\u0027t work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film\u0027s criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target. Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.\n\nIt\u0027s influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst\u0027s efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane. It\u0027s not just a masterpiece it\u0027s a creative touchstone.\n\nOf course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz\u0027s efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music. Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist\u0027s dreams, obsessions and fears. Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century",

      "reviewBody": "The year 1974 was very memorable. That year several films were successes which consisted of Francis Coppula\u0027s \"The Godfather:Part II\",Alan Pakula\u0027s political thriller \"The Parallex View\",Robert Aldrich\u0027s \"The Longest Yard\",and not to mention the disaster epics of the day;Irwin Allen\u0027s \"The Towering Inferno\",and Mark Robson\u0027s \"Earthquake\" not to mention the films \"The Conversation\",and \"The Great Gatsby\",\"Lenny\",and \"Blazing Saddles\" to name a few. But one film in particular stood out from all the rest and it shows why that was one of AFI\u0027s 100 top films of all time.\n\nThe year was 1974. The motion picture is \"Chinatown\". This was the movie that cemented Jack Nicholson as a bonafide superstar throughout the entire decade of the 1970\u0027s. This was the movie that started it all.\n\nJack Nicholson graduated from star to superstar playing a gumshoe in this marvelously intricate film noir of the 70\u0027s directed by Roman Polanski,who has a memorable cameo as a sadistic hood,gives Nicholson the most famous nose job in motion picture history. Robert Towne\u0027s Oscar winning script(whom they used in some acting and writing classes as a learning tool in some colleges)brilliantly depicts 1940\u0027s Los Angeles as a glittering cesspool of murder,incest,and corrupt land deals. Faye Dunaway steals the picture with a haunting performance as the film\u0027s alluring female fatale,and John Huston,as her creepy millionaire father,will make your skin crawl. The stunning finale still packs an emotional wallop. \"Chinatown\" was the apex of what the cinema of the 1970\u0027s was about to become,and this was the prime factor of that as well.\n\nThe film was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture and won three for Best Original Score(Jerry Goldsmith),Best Screenplay(Robert Towne),and Best Supporting Actor(John Huston).",

      "reviewBody": "On Leonardo DiCaprio\u0027s 31st birthday, I have the pleasure of praising one of the finest actors working today. I didn\u0027t realize what I was seeing when that homeless boy showed up on \u0027Growing Pains\u0027--a show not exactly known for the quality of its actors. And I didn\u0027t see much to like about \"Titanic\" except the excitement of watching the people evacuating and the ship sinking. Also, \u0027Romeo and Juliet\u0027 was just corny, with 400-year-old dialogue in a modern setting.\n\nBut if he could be nominated for his \u0027Aviator\u0027 performance, DiCaprio must be doing something right. And here he shows us what he is capable of. Especially when Frank Jr. is conning people, and most of all when he tries to outwit Hanatty. I am reminded of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in \"The Fugitive\", or perhaps Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in \"Smokey and the Bandit\". The strange but enjoyable chemistry between these two characters goes a long way toward making this movie work.\n\nFrank Jr. showed a lot of intelligence, and DiCaprio effectively showed us what this man could do. Imagine what he could have accomplished if he had stayed on the right side of the law. But his life on the run was more fun to watch.\n\nTom Hanks, as popular as he is, can be commended for his willingness to play second banana for a change. And he did a fine job. Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken also made an impact here.\n\nI loved the old cars and the even older songs. The clip from \u0027To Tell the Truth\u0027 was a nice touch. The theme song still gives me a craving for vanilla ice cream after nearly 30 years (I didn\u0027t feel I had time to watch the new version).\n\nThis was Oscar-caliber. Too bad the Academy Awards people didn\u0027t seem to agree.",

      "name": "Typically fantastic Scorcese film",
      "reviewBody": "I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever. Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the \"great film\" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. \n\nCasino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home. \n\nRobert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can\u0027t stand her, but that is the point. Scorcese\u0027s normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\n\n Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Being a child of the MTV age, I\u0027m a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master. Scorcese doesn\u0027t just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of \"Satisfaction\" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant. \n\nBeing a complete film geek, I generally don\u0027t go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them. While this was probably the tenth time I\u0027d seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll notice more upon my eleventh viewing. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies\" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.\n\n--Shelly",

      "reviewBody": "Sunday, November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio\u0027s death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild, in Paris, in 1900, he became a much sought-after character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir\u0027s idiosyncratic Rules of the Game, and Grand Illusion, arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman\u0027s heart, he married the very young, breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.\n\nBut then the Germans crushed Poland, swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally, with the sound of artillery clearly audible, with Madeleine, fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then, in a freight train, to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon, they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City, it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation, Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.\n\nMeanwhile, France had fallen and, in the process of subjugating the country, the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption \u0027a typical Jew\u0027 so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. \u0027Entree des artistes\u0027, a popular film, was ordered re-edited so that Dalio\u0027s scenes could be deleted and re-shot with another, non-Jewish, actor.\n\nAfter a short time, friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke, Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine, a budding actress in her own right, was ironically cast in \u0027Hold Back the Dawn\u0027, a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an émigré (Boyer) trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.\n\nIn early 1942, Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play, \u0027Everybody Comes to Rick\u0027s\u0027 but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.\n\nShooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as, respectively, a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screen-writers were hired to produce a running screenplay, sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day, for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And, of course, they produced a classic, perhaps the finest American movie.\n\nThey produced a screenplay of multiple genres, rich with characterizations, perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh, and they changed the title to \u0027Casablanca\u0027.\n\nIt is so well known, that many lines of long-memorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. \u0027We\u0027ll always have Paris\u0027, \u0027I was misinformed\u0027, \u0027Here\u0027s looking at you, kid\u0027, \u0027 I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there\u0027s gambling going on in here!\u0027, \u0027Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\u0027, \u0027Oh he\u0027s just like any other man, only more so\u0027, \u0027I don\u0027t mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one\u0027, \u0027Round up the usual suspects\u0027, and, of course, the oft quoted, apocryphal, \u0027Play it again, Sam\u0027.\n\nMadeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne, the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart, who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later, to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only self-hatred. She is luminous.\n\nAnd when Claude Rains delivers the signature line, \u0027I\u0027m shocked! Shocked! To find that there\u0027s gambling going on in here!\u0027 the croupier, Emil, played by Marcel Dalio, approaches from the roulette table and says simply, \u0027Your winnings, sir.\u0027 It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony, one among many in this film, but one made all the more so, knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.\n\nI have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.\n\nAlas, they separated and divorced the next year, both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.\n\nLate in his career, when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly, near-monologue in Catch-22, he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot, Dalio, as simply \u0027old man in whore house\u0027, in tight close-up, delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances, of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features, now beginning to sag, in a voice full of melancholy, the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what \u0027grand themes\u0027 may be afoot in the world, in the end, little matters but survival.",

I don\u0027t know why some Western-fans doesn\u0027t like it because it is filled with powerful and spectacular gunfights, humor, friendship and beautiful pictures - which is the reasons why you watch Westerns, isn\u0027t it? I am fully aware of the fact that \u0027Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\u0027 was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were other attempts or experiments made like this but I don\u0027t think that they succeeded. \u0027Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\u0027 has also the rare ability to even smell, taste or feel classic when you watch it ... Robert Redford was never better than here.\n\nRating: 9 of 10.",

People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn\u0027t free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb\u0027s list of greatest films.",

All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.\" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul \n\nScott brought out the best qualities in his performers He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they\u0027ve rarely topped You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it\u0027s so rich and it\u0027s painful I mean it\u0027s a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately \n\nThe overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there\u0027s such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by You have a sense of layers in that society That is one of those things that you see again and again The city landscape with the big billboards à la Kyoto or Tokyo Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you\u0027re right in \"Blade Runner\" country \n\n\"Blade Runner,\" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience It\u0027s the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is The images and the sound and the music, it\u0027s pure cinema Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia The intensity of his perfectionism on \"Blade Runner\" made the movie This is a master at his best",

Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. \n\nDespite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur\u0027s dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it\u0027s Ben Hur. And even now, after I\u0027ve seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don\u0027t mean that in a religious sense).\n\nMy verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many \"sandal and sword\" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.\n\nPure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",

That first thing said, i have to recognize that i\u0027m really hard on movies, and i usually discard many of them for being under-prepared, for so many errors and things like that. But with \"Before Sunset\" i felt different. We all know movies are just fakes: what happens, what we see is not the real life. It\u0027s just a construction. It\u0027s just somebody imagination becoming a visual media. But when i was watching this movie, i didn\u0027t felt that. I was seeing real people, with real problems and having thoughts, and fears and hopes. It\u0027s the most real acting i ever saw. All about it is just perfect: the ambiance, the set, the city, even the apartment we can see at the near end. Every piece of the movie was connected, and you can tell a whole story about the characters just for hear them, or seeing the way they talk, the things they said, the music they chooses or the things they have. In that way of thinking, i found this movie inspirational, a well-made piece of life, and incredibly deep and wide film. I think this is a portrait of life as only a few can know, of all the shadows and lights we all share.\n\nSo, i really recommend it, even if you didn\u0027t saw the first one.",

      "name": "Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. And such is the case for the Batman franchise",
      "reviewBody": "It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it\u0027s way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of \u0027Bat credit-cards\u0027 and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. \n\nEnter Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind 2000\u0027s \u0027Momento\u0027, widely praised as one of the most innovative films of the decade. As director/co- screenwriter, Nolan creates a richly dark, atmospheric world for Batman to inhabit, similar to that of the Burton films, but less cartoony. The film\u0027s screenplay, written by Nolan and David S. Goyer is quality stuff, it\u0027s true that some of the dialog exchanges can seem kind of contrived, particularly between Wayne and Liam Neeson\u0027s character, Ducard, but it sounds so classy you tend not to care. \n\nNolan also puts a lot of trust in his audiences to stay put while the first hour of the film comprehensively explores Bruce Wayne\u0027s backstory, with no cape donning and few fight sequences. Nevertheless, the pace never slows, and the story is so unexpected and fascinating (who would have expected a Batman film to begin in a prison in Tibet? only Nolan could pull it off!) there\u0027s little chance of us losing interest. And this way, we really get a sense of who Bruce Wayne is, a trait none of the past movies were able to capture, including the Burton films. We see what drives him, what leads him to become this iconic crime fighter, and the reasoning behind the mask.\n\nOf course, to help the audience get under Bruce Wayne\u0027s skin, it doesn\u0027t hurt to have such a talented lead as Christian Bale. Bale has been emerging as one of the most talented actors of his generation, and he brings that talent to a peak here, playing the darkest of all superheroes. If you were to break down the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne, you would find that it is essentially three characters: Wayne as Batman, behind the mask; Wayne\u0027s public facade as the billionaire playboy; and the real, brooding Bruce Wayne. Bale plays all three of the characters to absolute perfection, and molds them together well enough to make it clear to show they are still the same person. He has been given tons of accolades for his performance already, and needless to say, he deserves every one.\n\nAnd the sheer quality of the supporting cast is mind-boggling, if for the number of big names only. It\u0027s very hard to find a weak spot in the incredibly strong array of performances here, but if one had to be found, it would have to be Katie Holmes. It\u0027s not that she gives a bad performance, on the contrary, but just she seems too young to be convincing as a district attorney. For me, Michael Gough will always be the definitive Alfred, but Michael Caine does an excellent job of taking over the role, giving a very strong (and often funny) performance. Liam Neeson is sheer class as Ducard, Wayne\u0027s mysterious mentor, as is Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Wayne\u0027s arms manufacturer and provider of the Batman gear. It\u0027s wonderful to see the incredibly talented and much underrated Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the only decent cop in Gotham, and he truly makes the role his own. Even cult favorite Rutger Hauer makes an appearance as Richard Earle, the ambitious head of Wayne Enterprises. And (surprise surprise!) the villains are also actually menacing for once, as opposed to cartoony and corny. Cillian Murphy just about walks away with the show as the truly chilling Scarecrow (the sequences involving his \u0027fear gas\u0027 are surprisingly frightening) Ken Watanabe is mysterious and creepy as guild leader Ra\u0027s Al Ghul and Tom Wilkinson is very convincing as Carmine Falcone, head of the Gotham city mob. \n\nNolan\u0027s knack for realism also comes as a breath of fresh air in this age of CGI bloated blockbusters - there are next to no computer generated shots in the movie, even a sequence with Batman standing on top of a high building staring down at the city was filmed with a stuntman. And it really works, the Batmobile actually interacts with it\u0027s environment, and looks so much better real than computer generated. But don\u0027t think that the film will come across as too serious and stuffy because of Nolan\u0027s realism - true, Gotham seems too dark and dirty to come across as a fantasy world, but Batman Begins retains that unmistakable sense of fun that seems to only be present in comic book movies. We jeer and fear the villains, and cheer the hero as he lays his life on the line to vanquish evil and save the city. And that is how it should be. There\u0027s even a surprising twist near the end, which is doubly surprising because it actually comes as a shock. What\u0027s not to love here?\n\n(and, further cudos to director Nolan for finally managing to make a swarm of bats actually frightening for once)\n\nOverall, I\u0027d have to label Batman Begins \u0027The must see movie of the summer\u0027 - it\u0027s a well written, authoritatively directed, impeccably acted (especially by Bale\u0027s powerhouse lead performance and Cillian Murphy\u0027s sickly menacing Scarecrow) and very high quality production. Indeed, most other summer blockbusters could learn a thing or two from Batman Begins. If the Batman franchise died under it\u0027s own gaudiness years ago, let us rejoice this glorious rebirth - Batman truly does begin here.\n\n-10/10",

      "reviewBody": "While this is, in my opinion, not the best of Kubrick\u0027s films, it is in no way a bad film of his... some have claimed it is overlong and dull, but I don\u0027t think so. From what I\u0027ve heard, it does the novel justice, and I believe that is what Kubrick went after, more than anything else. That is admirable, for a man who throughout his career was known for making unfaithful film adaptations of famous and popular novels, much to the dismay of the authors. The film perfectly presents everything from the time period in which it takes place... something that few, if any, other films have accomplished. It deals with the life of Redmond Barry, his ups and downs. The first half has us feeling sympathy with him, and shows his rise to a high position and gain the name Barry Lyndon, and everything that entitles. The second seems to turn us a little more against him, as he goes through the expected downfall that must always follow an unexpected rise to high life. Through the film he gets desensitized and careless. We follow him through most of his life, and an uneventful one it is not. As all other Kubrick films, the visual side is probably the most prominent one of the film, as he grants us several long looks at the beautiful sets and locales, and there are more than a few of his trademark shots slowly zooming out from the focus point to display the surroundings. The plot is great, and almost constantly developing. It is narrated with a good sense of irony and clever social satire on the time period. There\u0027s plenty of humor in the film to make the three hour run-time seem less long. The pacing is good and thorough without the film being slow(though I do admit that it isn\u0027t a film for those who are not used to long, visual films). The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is excellent all the way. Not even the child-actors seemed less than perfectly convincing. The costumes and sets are great. From what I understand, there is no detail in the film that is even slightly historically inaccurate. That is quite impressive for a film that takes place about a century and a half before it was made. I have heard of great deals of work done to keep many films accurate, but I don\u0027t believe one exists that manages to do so with such perfection as this. Even the very language that they speak is accurate. The special effects in the film also deserve mention here... for a film that is almost thirty years old, it\u0027s impeccable how believable and convincing the effects are... I couldn\u0027t tell how most of them were done. Kubrick was indeed one of the most brilliant directors ever... he was not only a master at his craft, he was also one of the most innovative and inspiring film-makers to have ever lived. I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who has an interest in the time period the film is set and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. Don\u0027t miss this one. Not his greatest, but a truly great one nonetheless. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Bacheha-Ye aseman (Children of Heaven)\n\nIt was with some trepidation that I popped this DVD into the player - it was, after all, my first venture into Iranian cinema, so I was a little unsure what to expect. I am used to, and for the most part, enjoy foreign films. They open up an incredible world of cinema that one would otherwise miss. After five minutes, it was fairly evident that this film was something a bit special. The story is simple. While at market shopping, Ali loses his sisters school shoes. After desperately trying in vain to find them, he decides that he and his sister will share his sneakers, meeting her after to school each day to recover them from her, in order to get to school himself. That is pretty much a synopsis of the entire movie. It doesn\u0027t end there however...\n\nThis film is played with such beauty and innocence; it is a true pleasure to watch. Mohammad Amir Naji plays Ali with such incredible depth and passion, one is completely drawn into his plight. From the start of the film, we see the relationship between brother and sister, played with equal warmth by Bahare Seddiqi, strained as he explains how he lost her shoes. The sorrow on Ali\u0027s face, and Zahra\u0027s tears at the news, are truly heartbreaking to watch. The expressions on the faces of the children are so genuine, it is clear that spending a cinematic hour and half will be a pleasure, albeit not an easy one.\n\nWe see Ali and his Father looking for work as gardeners. From the outset it is clear that Ali\u0027s Father is strict, but it is also evident he loves his son dearly, and the simple exchange of smiles as they find their first job is heart-warming, and totally believable. Cycling through the city, it is very striking that there is a clear division between rich and poor. We are watching a boy, to afraid to tell his father of the loss of a pair of shoes, riding through streets with billboards advertising cell phones, into rural areas where houses with swimming pools, ornate architecture and luxury are rife.\n\nThere is so much in Western civilisation that we take for granted. What to us are simple daily belongings to others is pure decadence. Aside from anything else, this film is a window into a world so many of us do not understand. Simple things bring Ali pleasure, blowing bubbles, swinging on swings with his new found friend, the smiles and laughter of the children is absorbing.\n\nLater in the film we see Ali enter a race in order to win a pair of brand new sneakers for his sister. To win them, he must come third. Again we see the division of wealth, as Ali races through the streets, the thoughts and images of his sister swirling in his head, and on screen, while at the same time, parents of other children film the race on camcorders, all the time Ali running, fighting for the shoes he needs so desperately.\n\nThe film is directed perfectly, and the credit for this goes to Majid Majidi, whose films have won acclaim worldwide. There are no special effects, no luxurious settings. There are times when the film feels like a documentary in the direction, and that works in its favour. This film would make an excellent introduction into the world of foreign cinema. Throughout the movie, the expressions and emotions displayed by the children speak far louder than any dialogue ever could.\n\nThe film is not dialogue intensive, and one could easily watch the film, and understand the story, even without the aid of subtitles. This film was nominated for an Academy Award, and it not difficult to see why. Ignoring for a moment the subtitles and language barriers, since they are not overly crucial to the film, this is a story of true innocence, and tugs hard at the heartstrings, sometimes to breaking point. The portrayal of the children is gentle, warm and absolutely believable, and one cannot help but be drawn into this tale, as it gently unwinds. It is sometimes tough to watch the emotions played out, but ultimately, worth every second.\n\nMissing this film, particularly if simply put off by the fact it is foreign language, would a sad deprivation of the senses and the heart. It is not just a film, it is an experience, and one that is completely passionate, and totally unforgettable.\n\nI truly cannot recommend this highly enough. It is widely available on DVD or VHS - rent it, borrow it or buy it - you will be glad that you did!\n\nReviewed by Ollie",

      "reviewBody": "The acting was perfect in this movie from the kid (Deniz) to Çetin Tekindor (Hüseyin Aga). All player did their job in a great performance. Also the places the film shot was great. My grandfather lives in a similar village, and I used to go to there in summers in my early ages. I went to back again to my childhood when I was watching the movie. It reflects the life style of those places in a very good manner and reality. No detail was skipped. Also the director mixed the drama and joy in the movie very well so that you can laugh suddenly when you pity for something you see in the movie. This was, I think, a great directing success for the new generation director, Çagan Irmak. So, this a \"must to see\" film I think, especially for the Turkish viewers (It includes so much domestic features). But international viewers can also get a real good taste of it, because main themes (such as family bonds, love of son) in the movie are humane things.",

Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.",

No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it\u0027s still up there for one of their stronger movies. It\u0027s not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.\n\n TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",

      "reviewBody": "My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary \u0027Heart of Darkness\u0027 made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making \u0027the Godfather\u0027 and \u0027GodfatherII\u0027 and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like \u0027Apocalypse Now\u0027. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz\u0027s compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN\u0027T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about \u0027Apocalypse Now\u0027 is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. \n\nThis movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn\u0027t at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is \u0027Platoon\u0027 in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. \n\nCoppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.\n\nIt is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.\n\nA little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the \u0027Redux\u0027 version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a \u0027new and improved\u0027 version of the movie",

      "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for £8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don\u0027t take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it\u0027s not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it\u0027s just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself \u0027it\u0027s only a movie and I am sure it won\u0027t take anything away from it\u0027 and thankfully it didn\u0027t. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don\u0027t usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn\u0027t really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother\u0027s girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn\u0027t like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.\n\nWhen Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it\u0027s not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn\u0027t seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it\u0027s best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.\n\nThe movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn\u0027t taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn\u0027t seem very convincing and doesn\u0027t really go anywhere. You think it\u0027s just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn\u0027t make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn\u0027t make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. \n\nAnother good solid foreign film that didn\u0027t hit all the marks but still very good.",

      "reviewBody": "I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.\n\nThe movie its story is told \u0027beautifuly\u0027 in black \u0026 white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn\u0027t that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you\u0027re causing to yourself and your close environment when you\u0027re thinking as a white supremacist.\n\nAs an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.\n\nEdward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It\u0027s almost like he\u0027s playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene\u0027s are highly believable as two brothers.\n\nAlso surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for \"The Full Monty\", the year before.\n\nThis was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.\n\n10/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

      "reviewBody": "\"American Beauty\" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes\u0027 brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own \u0027American Dream\u0027 - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.\n\nHaving seen \"Happiness\" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply \u0027happy\u0027. But here the similarities end: the characters in \"Happiness\" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. \"Happiness\" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in \"American Beauty\" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.\n\nThe pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.\n\nMendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his \u0027path to enlightenment\u0027 pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: \"My life is like a commercial\". And how this rings true: like in \"Happiness\", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.\n\nLester\u0027s wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film\u0027s tone of moral conviction. \"In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success\" is the maxim she adopts from the \u0027king\u0027 of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning\u0027s pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of \u0027normal life\u0027 and following what his heart desires.\n\nLester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.\n\nThis film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain \u0027American Dream\u0027, yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the \u0027feel good\u0027 label, the beauty of \"American Beauty\" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best.",

      "reviewBody": "In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.\n\nThe movie of Salieri\u0027s life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.\n\nThe priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father\u0027s untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how \"The Creature\" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri\u0027s heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.\n\nAs the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.\n\nThe movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.\n\nThe movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said \"(It) is a gem because it\u0027s possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision.\" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.\n\nAmadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king.",

      "reviewBody": "I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience. The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It\u0027s an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to \"act\" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.\n\n\"All About Eve\" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films \"A Face in the Crowd\". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face\u0027s premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.\n\nAnd possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so \"liberated\" today. So what more can I say? If you love movies and you haven\u0027t yet seen it, you\u0027ve suffered long enough; don\u0027t wait another day.",

      "reviewBody": "Aliens is as good as its predecessor but not quite the same as its more action and less horror. Director James Cameron does an eminent job as well as making Aliens an exhilarating, quotable and ultimately unforgettable.\n\nThe plot is simple, Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep and finds out that the moon she previously visited is colonised but by whom... The eeriness and fear are replaced with intense action and larger than life marines. Replaced for good? Yes and no, What made Alien great is its eerie music tone and sound design with the alien being more feared. However what makes Aliens great is the exact opposite, more aliens result in more action and more intensity as if its a new lease on life.\n\nWe\u0027re introduced into a brand new Ripley, she\u0027s a survivor now and Sigourney Weaver does a nearly flawless job utilising her character. The technicalities are kept and the sound design is overhauled in an impressive way.\n\nLike all movies, Aliens isn\u0027t flawless and it does have one slightly major plot hole: Hicks knew the aliens were going to breach their perimeter sooner or later yet no one suggested going to the other dropship until they learned about the nuclear disaster. Meaning they were going to sit in that same room for seventeen days with barely any ammo and 100+ aliens breaking in only if the reactors didn\u0027t go critical.\n\nAliens knows what it wants to be and makes a genre-defying attempt doing it.\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10",

There\u0027s also an interesting mystery surrounding the Alien which we know practically nothing about. Sigourney Weaver is just as powerful as usual and really brings strength to the film; they make one. Last but not least, the musical score. Wow! It\u0027s fantastic. I think the Alien series is known for that aspect as well. Let\u0027s hope they\u0027ll continue the series and dang we need it all on DVD !",

The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can\u0027t stop again and keeps you laughing.\n\nThe story is good and the pace is high. \"Aladdin\" is not too short and it\u0027s not too long, it\u0027s not too immature and it\u0027s not too mature, it\u0027s a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it\u0027s no \"Beauty and the Beast\") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.\n\n9/10",

Beyond that this anime is famously the first, and a very early example, of an animation with completely matching and synchronous mouth movements for all the characters, which is an achievement for the fictitious and full-length feature. They are remaking this in Hollywood. I have owned a DVD of Akira for two decades and watch it every year. I will not be attending the American \u0027Akira.\u0027",

The softness of language in this movie, draws you more into the setting, atmosphere and characters. \n\nOn the other hand, the acting skills shown by all of their actors and actresses are simply flawless and amazing. I don\u0027t what is it about these asian actors that they don\u0027t overplay nor fall into too much screaming or cheesy acting. This is something else!\n\nI highly recommend this movie to understand better the depths of our most innate human emotions and nature.",

And I found the film pretty enjoyable and I reflected upon it even after ending.\n\nI found the rhythm to which the story was told perfectly paced and beautifully told, showing how Nash lived before, during and after finding out about his schizophrenia, and how he overcame it. I give the plot and story a 8/10, because, as much as it entertained me - which it did - I was absolutely not paying that much attention, for the film didn\u0027t bring me that much closer to it. And, as much the film made me reflect how someone can be successful while coping with mental illness, I thought about it for two minutes before dropping. I\u0027m not saying movies really need that, but a story as profound as this one could\u0027ve.\n\nOn the other end, we have the visuals. The colors were beautifully executed. Being quite warm in times of genius creativity and cold in times of illness. There was something great that came to my attention, those layered shots, which showed how separate Nash was from the world when he was thinks. But that\u0027s how far it got. It was good, but not great. So, I give the visual style of this film a 8/10.\n\nOverall, I think this movie goes for a low 8.\n\nI\u0027m no movie pro. I just like watching them.",

This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it..\" \"Chase Excellence and success will follow\".. \" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams\".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...\n\n3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn\u0027t get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel \u0027 Five Point Someone \u0027 by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..\n\nThe movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film\u0027s music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani\u0027s screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan\u0027s finest film to date.. The film\u0027s climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...\n\nTo conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...\n\nMy Rating: 9/10\n\nThanks and Regards",

Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.\n\nThe Space Odyssey is not something one can just \"go and see\". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don\u0027t think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it\u0027s genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring \u0027Also spracht Zarathustra\u0027 by Richard Strauss and \u0027Blue Danube\u0027 by Johann Strauss.\n\nTake all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.\n\nOr maybe I\u0027m just plain crazy...",

      "reviewBody": "Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)\n\nOne of the things that have been thrown around for months now is the notion that awards season voting bodies won\u0027t respond to it because it\u0027s too \"difficult\" to sit through. Let\u0027s define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I\u0027d argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of \"too difficult\" around.\n\nI\u0027ve watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I\u0027ve seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg\u0027s \"Schindler\u0027s List\" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass\u0027 \"United 93\", which is almost an emotional biopic of America\u0027s darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson\u0027s \"The Passion of the Christ\", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, \"it\u0027s too hard watch.\" Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone\u0027s ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can\u0027t answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn\u0027t just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.\n\nNow when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.\n\nI have long admired the talent that\u0027s been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I\u0027ve known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.\n\nAs Edwin Epps, Solomon\u0027s last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the \"Amon Goeth\" of our tale, he is exactly what you\u0027d expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He\u0027s vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.\n\nMark my words; Lupita Nyong\u0027o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful \"Patsey\" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You\u0027re watching the birth of a star.\n\nHans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP\u0027s in the business. Especially following his work in \"The Place Beyond the Pines\" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.\n\nOscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar\u0027s in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There\u0027s also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master\u0027s house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven\u0027t seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this \"difficult\" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there\u0027s no reason it can\u0027t top the night. I\u0027m very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in \"12 Years a Slave?\" I remain hopeful.",

      "reviewBody": "\u002712 Angry Men\u0027 is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.\n\nThe twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?\n\nThe court case provides only a framework, however. The film\u0027s greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.\n\nAlmost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.\n\nHenry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury\u0027s duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.\n\nSeveral of the stars of \u002712 Angry Men\u0027 became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in \u0027The Virginian\u0027. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the \u0027Kennedy\u0027 mini-series. Jack Klugman was \u0027Quincy\u0027 whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the \u0027Winnie The Pooh\u0027 films and cartoons.\n\nOf the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!\n\n(*John Fiedler died June 2005. Jack Warden died July 2006.)",
