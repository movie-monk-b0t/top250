      "reviewBody": "This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.\n\nOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red\u0027s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". \n\nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. \n\nWhatever you do, don\u0027t listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",

      "name": "An Iconic Film",
      "reviewBody": "Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can\u0027t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.\n\nThe acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.\n\nThe writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.\n\nThe directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.\n\nThe cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.\n\nThe horse\u0027s head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I\u0027ll give him an offer he can\u0027t refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don\u0027t know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.",

Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchable\"\n\nThe second part of Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. \n\nThis is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola\u0027s second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. \n\n\"As close to perfection as movies get\"\n\n\"Pacino at his best\"\n\n-10/10-",

A perfect example of less is more, the simplicity of the plot, the setting of the one room, and the acting talent of the 12 main cast members is enough to conquer the dramatic genre, and ensure that it remains a timeless classic.\n\nWhether you are a fan of the older generation of filmmaking or not, I implore you to experience this acting masterclass for yourself. More current movies such as Resevoir Dogs, which is superb in itself, have borrowed elements from 12 Angry Men, but trust me when I say there is nothing quite like this beautifully crafted drama.

      "reviewBody": "I don\u0027t know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler\u0027s List. At first I thought, well, maybe I\u0027ll watch a few minutes of it- it\u0027s so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change. I hadn\u0027t seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial. I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure. After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film. It certainly wasn\u0027t something to dwell on.\n\nThis time when I watched the film I really surprised myself. I sat and cried like I haven\u0027t in years- but that\u0027s a good thing. I\u0027ve been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.\n\nNow, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things. Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a pile of personal photographs of family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses. That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.\n\nI will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock. I was kind of mad at Spielberg. I mean, doesn\u0027t he know when to back off. It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly \"sentimental\" passage with violins going haywire.\n\nRegardless, I\u0027m in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever.",

      "name": "Not only the best of the \"Lord of the Rings\" series, but sets a new standard of epic filmmaking.",
      "reviewBody": "Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers\u0027 left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm\u0027s Deep. `Return of the King\u0027 opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,\u0027 at that\u0027s the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,\u0027 provided heaps of exposition on the ring\u0027s importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,\u0027 we see it pay off, big time.\n\nAfter the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings\u0027 before expecting to follow this film.\n\nSince all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King\u0027 is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.\n\nAll of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,\u0027 but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis\u0027 provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).\n\nHowever, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood\u0027s performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring\u0027s power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.\n\nThe first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,\u0027 Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King\u0027 a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return\u0027 as a mix of `Fellowship\u0027 and `Two Towers,\u0027 with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.\n\nThe bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u0027 is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.",

      "name": "Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90\u0027s. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez\u0027s was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70\u0027s. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.\n\nIt was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I\u0027m not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino\u0027s or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.\n\nAnyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that\u0027s really a contradiction because one of the movie\u0027s finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I\u0027m concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a \"tough guy\" image at the beginning and then we discover he\u0027s so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it\u0027s highest point.\n\nThe other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. \"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...\" is my favourite quote.\n\nSummarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.",

      "name": "Westerns don\u0027t get any better than this.",
      "reviewBody": "This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called \"spaghetti western\" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.\n\nSomehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. \n\nI have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn\u0027t like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it\u0027s coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. \n\nAnother example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe\u0027s subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. \n\nIn my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film \"Dr. Zhivago\" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn\u0027t release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it\u0027s over, you feel that you\u0027ve been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.\n\nIn summary, if you haven\u0027t seen this film, buy it right away. Don\u0027t rent it because you will not want to part with it once you\u0027ve seen it.\n\nThen curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.",

This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher\u0027s cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky \u0027cutting edge\u0027 nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.\n\nThis movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "Forrest Gump (1994) \n\n**** (out of 4) \n\nForrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend.\n\nFORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I\u0027ve never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don\u0027t understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there\u0027s FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.\n\nAs far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I\u0027ve always liked how the film took a look at a simple person\u0027s life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they\u0027ve entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it\u0027s always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.\n\nI thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I\u0027ve always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there\u0027s no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.\n\nThen there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY\u0027S FOOL, there\u0027s no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that \"simple\" man and there\u0027s not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank\u0027s character and Sally Field is good as well.\n\nNo matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.",

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). \n\nThe plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It\u0027s great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.\n\nInception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you\u0027re thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. \n\nTruly unique, like nothing i\u0027ve ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn\u0027t afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.",

      "reviewBody": "`It avoids having the standard shoot-\u0027em-up ending,\u0027 says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.\u0027 I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I\u0027m therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can\u0027t discuss this without giving things away to those few who don\u0027t know what happens. If you\u0027re one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.\n\nAfter the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han\u0027s party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.\n\nThe training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn\u0027t matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han\u0027s being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it\u0027s the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi\u0027, which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That\u0027s enough.\n\nAs for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke\u0027s human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.\n\nWhen George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You\u0027ll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn\u0027t room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It\u0027s also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",

The battle of Helm\u0027s Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding. \n\nThe scene\u0027s with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene\u0027s were great. The scene\u0027s show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river. \n\nThe further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo. \n\nThe breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom\u0027s character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time. \n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King.",

The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.\n\nTime passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls.\n\nRecently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel.\n\nWe can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.\n\nI suggest watching The Matrix even if you\u0027ve already watched it.",

      "reviewBody": "Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain\u0027t gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.\n\nI\u0027ll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn\u0027t happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it\u0027s like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.\n\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

      "reviewBody": "The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO\u0027S NEST is a bleak glance at an Oregon morning. Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches. Inside the car is one of film history\u0027s most remarkable characters. \"Randle McMurphy\" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as \"McMurphy\", is something of a paradox. Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be? That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.\n\nMilos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later. It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds. Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax. Not before or since CUCKOO\u0027S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me. You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward. The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.\n\nNicholson has his greatest moments in this picture. One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV. It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity. \"McMurphy\" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don\u0027t have to stick to the \"normal routine\". He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a \"date\". \n\nLouise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as \"Nurse Mildred Ratched\". She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win. Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional. That\u0027s perfect because that is exactly who she is. Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited \"McMurphy\" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.\n\nONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO\u0027S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated. Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together. Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused. He seems to love his compadres in the hospital. He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.\n\nThere is no denying the power of CUCKOO\u0027S NEST. The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the \"Chief\" is great as Nicholson\u0027s right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on. The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. \n\nNOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version. Comparing a book to a movie is impossible. They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.",

      "reviewBody": "I discovered 16 of Kurosawa\u0027s best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It\u0027s basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you\u0027ve ever seen. \n\nThe premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.\n\nThe samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. \n\nThe story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).\n\nIn the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film. The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt\u0027s supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.\n\nThe movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting. There is a \"Pseudo-Noir\" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it\u0027s philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.\n\nAndrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes. As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy. In this respect, the film doesn\u0027t \"preach\" any special meaning even though the film\u0027s moral statements are still maintained. This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.\n\nOutstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****",

      "reviewBody": "\u0027What are you doing, you\u0027re just a kid?\u0027 \"I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man.\"\n\nMany who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.\n\nBut such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.\n\nBut as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.\n\nOn the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian \"Angels With Dirty Faces.\u0027 One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.\n\nBut when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.\n\nThe most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the \u0027white-suit cool\u0027 present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.\n\nThe fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.\n\nStylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho\u0027s headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)\u0027s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.\n\nYou see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself.",

I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It\u0027s actually funny.\n\nBenigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I\u0027ve ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn\u0027t scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He\u0027s got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you\u0027re witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.\n\nI loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.",

      "reviewBody": "Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old. \"The Silence of the Lambs\" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die. The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster. Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal. Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal. At the heart of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster. They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema. Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film. This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece. 5 stars out of 5.",

There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of \"It\u0027s A Wonderful Life\" still hold true today. Yes, I\u0027ll say it, it\u0027s a wonderful movie.",

      "reviewBody": "\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\"\n\nPre review:\n\nIt\u0027s writing started in January 1973, \"eight hours a day, five days a week\", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThen, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was \"too strange\".\n\nSuddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that deeply trusted in Lucas genius. And that\u0027s how Star Wars became a reality.\n\nThe filming of the movie was difficult, full of mishaps, problems with practical effects, a bad first edit of the movie, but that did not stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, the Fox Study began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...\n\nReview:\n\nStar Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure and excitement. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...\n\nOne of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick\u0027s revolutionary masterpiece: \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.\n\nThe story and the characters are original and compelling. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer\u0027s desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel \"in distress\", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.\n\nThe visual composition is authentic and gives the movie a powerful aesthetic value, such as the \u0027Binary Sunset\u0027 scene, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke\u0027s character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he can see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for the dreamer he really is.\n\nThe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.\n\nFor sound design, Lucas wanted real noises, not synthesized science-fiction twitters. Thus Star Wars\u0027s spacecraft doors open and sandcrawlers rumble with whooshes and clatter from the Philadelphia subway, recorded by soundman Ben Burtt.\n\n Star Wars is far more experimental than believe. Lucas\u0027s new methods baffled Fox executives, as he used two and sometimes three or four cameras: encouraging improvisation, he reserved his options for postproduction. He called for naturalistic acting to anchor the space fantasy. He started in close, avoiding establishing shots. He wanted a nostalgic \"filtered look\" but kept changing key lights for a \"flashing, strobing\" effect. He used a loose, \"nervous\" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray.\n\nBooks such as \"The hero with a thousand faces\" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa\u0027s storytelling influenced the focused on minor characters... The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.\n\n10/10",

People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don\u0027t even realise you\u0027re reading.\n\nAnyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!",

I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank\u0027s character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank\u0027s performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",

      "reviewBody": "Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn\u0027t get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children\u0027s mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator\u0027s thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.\n\ne.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don\u0027t mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.\n\nApart from that, did you ever notice that some \"camera language\" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the \"camera\" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji\u0027s introduction about Haku\u0027s background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.\n\nThere\u0027re many other things like this, shouldn\u0027t be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that\u0027s not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.\n\nI am a visual effects person and film maker but I can\u0027t tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character\u0027s movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don\u0027t have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio\u0027s work. \"Spirited Away\" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.\n\n\"Ice Age\" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with \"Spirited Away\" I\u0027m afraid. And I\u0027d laugh at the opinion that the story of \"Ice Age\" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn\u0027t recognise it, actually I believe \"Spirited Away\" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while \"Ice Age\" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I\u0027m afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one.",

      "reviewBody": "THE GREEN MILE (1999) ****\n\nStarring: Tom Hanks, David Morse, Michael Clarke Duncan, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Doug Hutchison, and Gary Sinise Written and directed by Frank Darabont. Running Time: 180 minutes. Rated R (for scenes of strong disturbing violence, language, and some sexuality)\n\n By Blake French:\n\n\tIt\u0027s not everyday that a movie is able to change an audiences opinion on something. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that made me think long and hard about supporting the death penalty. The film, based on a novel by Stephen King, contains such a variety of emotional events that it repels its audience away from its subject rather than glamorizing it. Only a handful of recent productions have been capable of such power. \"The Green Mile\" is truly one of the best films this year and is Oscar Worthy in many categories. It is a unique, three hour experience that must be seen to believe. \n\nThe story is more of a personal narrative than an actual plot. The film offers an interesting perspective of the events that take place. It is seen through the eyes of a man who is over one hundred years of age, Paul Edgecomb, who is currently living in an old folks home with his friend, Elaine. During a very emotional day for Paul, he tells Elaine of a historical year in his experiences. She listens closely to his story.\n\nHe tells of a particular year in the 1930\u0027s. The setting is a beautifully crafted prison hall. Paul explains he used to be a kind prison guard on death row in charge of overseeing the executions. In this year, several significant activities occurred in his life: he had a terribly painful urinary infection, and met a prisoner named John Coffey. This man has been sentenced to the electric chair for the rape and murder of two innocent little girls. This man isn\u0027t like anyone else Paul has seen, however. Aside from being massive in size, he is humble, mild mannered, and caring. After several miraculous events take place that may point to the thought that John Coffey might have magical powers from God, Paul begins to doubt the crimes this so called criminal has been convicted of. \n\n\tThroughout the story we witness three executions that in an electric chair. These capital punishment sequences have much power and significance. The electrocutions, one in particular, contain some of the most unsettling, disturbing material in film history. The movie is anti death penalty; we see the sometimes sadistic world from the prisoner guards point of view. It will put you in their shoes--and perhaps, change your opinion on the death penalty. I certainly had to think about my stand on this issue.\n\n I did have questions that were not really answered by the filmmakers. I wanted more on John Coffey\u0027s magical powers; the miracles aren\u0027t investigated enough to suit our pleas. I think the movie could have also stood on a firmer platform of religion. We assume that Coffey\u0027s abilities are a gift from God from the character\u0027s dialogue, but religion itself is more of a theme in the film than a message or plot point. I can perfectly see why the writers decided to leave these elements to the audiences imagination, to provoke participation. So I suppose my objections are not really flaws, just personal aspirations.\n\n\"The Green Mile\" contains so many vivid performances, I will not be able to honor everyone who deserves credit in my review. Michael Jeter, Gary Sinise, Doug Hutchison, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, and David Morse are all superior in strength of their characters. Each contributes Oscar worthy performances, and if the Academy leaves these individuals out at Award time, they need to recheck their databases. Michael Clarke Duncan recently received a Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role, and he deserves it. Tom Hanks is just unspeakably brilliant in the leading role. He is right behind Kevin Spacey from \"American Beauty\" in the best performance of 1999. \n\n The message to \"The Green Mile\" is clear and understandable: justice isn\u0027t always just and the miracles can happen in the most unexpected of places. This film is one of the most penetrating dramas of the past several years. It will induce your mind to think about its subjects, and gradually build on you. \"The Green Mile\" is a movie that will stick with you long after the ending credits role by. \n\nBrought to you by Warner Bros.",

While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn\u0027t seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",

      "reviewBody": "Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one\u0027s beliefs.\n\nEvery frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film\u0027s technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa\u0027s samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa\u0027s work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being \"a facade\" to directly quote the film.\n\nI say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",

Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he\u0027s groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****",

      "reviewBody": "Strong performances by Edward Norton \u0026 Edward Furlong really make this film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black \u0026 white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic, ironically by a British director. The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature \u0026 brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day. AHX tracks Derek\u0027s history through the first formation of racist sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo Nazi propaganda. The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends. Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the Anti-Jewish sepal he\u0027s been living with so long. The problem lies with his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being influenced like he was. Derek\u0027s cross to bear is that he can\u0027t change his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right side of humanity. I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants the same for his brother. Kaye\u0027s use of black \u0026 white creates an atmospheric drama that builds tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by the same man (Derek / Norton). Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong. To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on every high school curriculum",

Set 15 years after the original Arnie may return as the good Terminator trying to protect John Connor but he\u0027s a redundant piece of scrap metal compared to the T-1000.\n\nThe opening hour and the last half hour is absolutely breathtaking with action sequences that still remain unsurpassed. Their\u0027s also a wonderful piece of storytelling 3/4 of the way through where Dyson relises the terrifying consequences of the project he\u0027s neglecting his family for.\n\nThe performances are memorable particularly Linda Hamilton\u0027s Sara Connor and simply put, they\u0027ll never make a better action film.",

      "reviewBody": "Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the early-1930s due to the advent of sound (a medium that just never seemed right with him). Chaplin, probably the best film-maker/performer of the 20th Century, did not despair though. He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 \"Modern Times\" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. As a factory worker in the film, Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing U.S. economy. He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard (who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life) and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change. \"Modern Times\" is one of those films that will put a smile on your face, but it could make you weep just as easily. Chaplin\u0027s world was changing (and not necessarily for the better from his point of view) and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted. Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplin\u0027s charm in one of his pictures. Their love for one another (even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life) just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heart-warming. Beautifully made, wonderfully written, perfectly performed, smart, insightful and always brilliant, \"Modern Times\" is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

      "reviewBody": "What can you say about a film that\u0027s been talked about to death? Just this: If you\u0027ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it\u0027s a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it\u0027s so fun to watch.\n\nJanet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss\u0027s obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk\u0027s possessive mother, who as her boy explains, \"is not herself today.\" I\u0027ll say she isn\u0027t, and so would Leigh\u0027s Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign before taking a shower.\n\nYou can feel the decade literally shifting out of \u002750s and into \u002760s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what\u0027s going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.\n\nMost especially, there\u0027s Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion\u0027s boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word \"falsity\" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.\n\nHe shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam\u0027s boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you\u0027re always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he\u0027s busy covering up \"Mother\u0027s\" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.\n\nIf you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote\u0027s. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for \"Psycho.\" Certainly \"Psycho\" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.\n\nIt\u0027s thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.\n\nIs it the best Hitchcock movie? It\u0027s definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.\n\nOften imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, \"Psycho\" still isn\u0027t played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",

      "name": "Is Crowe the \u0027next action hero?\u0027",
      "reviewBody": "Germania, 150 AD, the setting of Gladiator\u0027s opening scene. Far from the blazing sun and dazzlingly beauty of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott shoots the opening sequence in a subdued light. The Roman legions are nonetheless impeccably turned out as they face the comparatively disorganised rabble that inhabits this miserable environment. Caesar\u0027s soldiers seem somewhat misplaced here. However, Russell Crowe is at home in this environment of knee-deep mud and merciless snow. He commands the screen with all the virtues of his motto: Strength and Honour.\u0027\n\nThe plot, with its hero-to-zero-to-hero nature, runs through Gladiator\u0027s every vein. As General Maximus, Russell Crowe is welcomed by Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Richard Harris) to take the Roman throne as Emperor of a new Republic. All does not run smoothly however as mislead heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) takes over Rome with ill-gotten domination, having dispatched his own Father. Maximus is cast out to find his family murdered and his Spanish farm burnt to the ground. Taken in as a slave by Proximo (Reed), Maximus becomes a Gladiator and starts his journey to the Coliseum and revenge against Commodus.\n\nScott\u0027s cast is powerful and he is not left wanting as powerful performances are delivered by all. Due to his untimely mid-production death, Oliver Reed is created in some scenes by the grace of computer graphics, which are as convincing as they come; sometimes making it difficult to differentiate between Reed himself and his computerised counterpart.\n\n It is, however, the supporting actors who create many of Gladiator\u0027s best dialogue-based scenes. In an accomplished demonstration of her acting ability as Lucilla, Connie Nielsen saves the occasional scene as Joaquim Phoenix shows us that he can do evil\u0027, but is less convincing when it comes to the more emotional qualities of his role.\n\nAs a vehicle for the plot, Scott\u0027s beautifully created and highly symbolic (there is an image of fire in nearly every shot of the film) dialogue scenes are of a certain merit with digitally created backgrounds that encompass the meticulous nature of the Roman Empire. However, dialogue alone does not an epic movie make, and it is in the film\u0027s spectacular action sequences that Gladiator come into its own. Shot on location in Malta, Scott\u0027s first arena was built by an army of locals and commanded some 5000 extras (a large majority of whom were of a cardboard variety). All of this pales in comparison as we arrive in a digitally created Rome which makes some scenes in Ben Hur some somewhat small scale. The Coliseum is immense, both inside and out, and the computerised provides the electric atmosphere in which Crowe and his feline companions (four sizeable, and real, Bengal tigers) perform.\n\nThe battle sequences are perfectly choreographed and shot as iconic masks and typically Roman chariots are abundant in their power and imagery. As swords clash and heads roll, Ridley Scott is triumphant in the application of special effects technology and his directorial prowess.\n\nAlways one to embrace technology, Scott\u0027s views over Rome\u0027s landscape are reminiscent of the beautifully created cityscape of Blade Runner. This is a film that fears so little and boasts so much, even a lady archer being sliced clean in half by a spiked chariot wheel!\n\nAll those involved with Gladiator should be delighted and confident with their creation, for indeed this is a convincing and enthralling display with epic proportions to take the wind from James Cameron\u0027s titanic sails.",

MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn\u0027t make a bad movie, and I\u0027m not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.\n\nThat ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it\u0027s a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin\u0027s little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It\u0027s a monument to understated sentimentality.\n\nTo me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it\u0027s that ending that makes us all love this movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The Departed\n\nThe screenplay: Top Notch\n\nThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performances\n\nThe music: perfect\n\nThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.\n\nOnce again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, \"Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.\" \n\nThis film is Scorsese\u0027s finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. \n\nHowever the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg\u0027s Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.\n\nSince The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.\n\nThat was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",

      "name": "An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.",
      "reviewBody": "Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it\u0027s a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it\u0027s a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it\u0027s the best film I\u0027ve seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. \n\nMiles Teller, who\u0027s been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who\u0027s pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we\u0027ve never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They\u0027re urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he\u0027s looking for and when someone\u0027s wrong even if you don\u0027t know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He\u0027s a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it\u0027s not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he\u0027s known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. \n\nEven though he\u0027s an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he\u0027s still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey\u0027s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it\u0027s a crime or an \u0027ends justifying the means\u0027 factor of life. It\u0027s not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we\u0027re not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew\u0027s psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That\u0027s why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it\u0027s so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller\u0027s performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. \n\nChazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It\u0027s the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew\u0027s head however. It\u0027s a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it\u0027s merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn\u0027t be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it\u0027s cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he\u0027ll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he\u0027s pushed further and further. \n\nThe technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It\u0027s thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There\u0027s a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it\u0027s so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it\u0027ll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn\u0027t just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I\u0027ll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.\n\n10/10. Best film of the decade.\n\nRead more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",

      "reviewBody": "Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.\n\nThe final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in \u0027The Prestige\u0027s arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. \u0027The turn\u0027 comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.\n\nThe prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of \u0027The Prestige\u0027 of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a \"gotcha\"-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.\n\nOur two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale\u0027s technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the \u0027Abracadabra\u0027 entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan\u0027s.\n\nTo further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine\u0027s character puts forward.\n\nWith Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. \u0027Antihero\u0027 gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate \u0027prestige\u0027 of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public\u0027s recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.\n\n\u0027The Prestige\u0027 is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan\u0027s next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).\n\n9 out of 10",

He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events, with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations (something Argento has since picked up). Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone, even peripheral characters, and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.\n\nOUATITW features the most tense two man stand-offs ever, with some serious deja-vu in the direction of his \"Dollars\" trilogy. In fact, it does feel like those three movies were warm ups, practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though, he perfected everything; despite the long running time, it\u0027s all focused, and without a single irrelevant scene. For me, the two hours plus just fly by, I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this, that\u0027s not to say that he went downhill from then on, but I honestly don\u0027t think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.\n\nThe cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop, truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character, the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just (incredible) window dressing; she switches between passionate, angry, delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.\n\nWhich leaves the hero; I\u0027m a huge Eastwood fan, but I honestly don\u0027t believe he could have done the role justice. His \"man with no name\" was a cool, sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities, with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson, on the other hand, mostly does himself; simple, uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind, that\u0027s why he\u0027s put in so many revenge flicks. Plus, he looks like he\u0027s been seriously wronged at some point in his life, Eastwood doesn\u0027t have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hard-as-nails article. You can readily imagine that, had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation, he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie (sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0- could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?).\n\nOf course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it, regardless of the mood I\u0027m in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something, I don\u0027t know, but that\u0027s the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film, it\u0027s unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music, and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back, it consistently cracks me up.\n\nHigh Noon, Naked Spur, Shane, The Searchers, etc. are all classics of the genre, but I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to compare those \"traditional\" westerns with OUATITW. For me, it exists on a plane of it\u0027s own, it\u0027s the kind of film experience that you let wash over you, a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone, if you\u0027re on the right wavelength you\u0027ll be greatly rewarded.",

I hesitated at first, but then I said \"Oh well, I\u0027ll give it a try.\" At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I\u0027ve ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.\n\nThis movie isn\u0027t your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I\u0027m not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn\u0027t trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.\n\nI am kind of upset, that this movie didn\u0027t get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi\u0027s best movie they have ever released.\n\nI truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.\n\nAn Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.\n\nQuite Simply 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB. Many of them exhort its greatness. I don\u0027t disagree with them.\n\nBut I\u0027d like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven\u0027t seen this film. I\u0027d like to tell you HOW to watch it.\n\nThe people who made this movie didn\u0027t think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted. The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more. Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.\n\nSo as an audience member, you can\u0027t sit down expecting gilded greatness.\n\nDon\u0027t have a Casablaca party. Don\u0027t watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that \"Romantic Touch.\" Don\u0027t watch it as part of your \"I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time\" Film School project.\n\nBuy this movie on DVD. Have it at the ready. And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it\u0027s 10:30pm and there\u0027s nothing on TV that\u0027s any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.\n\nThe characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism. Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses. As Rick says, \"Three little people don\u0027t amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.\" If you\u0027re in a mood where you understand what he\u0027s saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.\n\nThere is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time. Because movies, when all is said and done, don\u0027t amount to a hill of beans. They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.\n\nBut no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.\n\n If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no \"hype,\" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing. And that will be enough to start you on your way.\n\nHappy viewing, kid.",

      "reviewBody": "Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience\u0027s thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors\u0027 private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he\u0027s looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly\u0027s) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn\u0027t trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It\u0027s a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock\u0027s first truly \u0027fifties\u0027 film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he\u0027d been doing before. There\u0027s less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it\u0027s romantic about couples and cynical about people. There\u0027s a little bit of everything in it,--it\u0027s a work of art.",

      "reviewBody": "After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer \"director\u0027s cut.\"\n\nMost of the new footage involved the main\u0027s character\u0027s romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.\n\nThe first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as \"Toto\" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult \"Alfredo\" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.\n\nThe word \"love\" is used repeatedly in this review because that\u0027s the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.\n\nThe second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and \"Elena\" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.\n\nIt\u0027s very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his \"masterpiece.\"",

Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.\n\nThe story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel \"Nostromo\" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.\n\nThe music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.\n\nThis is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. \"Alien\" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10\n\nRated R: violence/gore and profanity",

      "name": "Excellent tribute to Conrad...",
      "reviewBody": "This film was incredibly well done, and the similarities to Conrad\u0027s Heart of Darkness were amazing, creating a similar message in the end. The first scene is everything: the cinematography was perfect, and The End by the Doors as the soundtrack worked eerily well. Lighting throughout the movie, especially surrounding the mysterious Kurtz (although it was needed) also worked well to establish the mood. \n\nThroughout the movie, we are encouraged to see that Kurtz\u0027 inhumanity likely stems from being put in a situation where he answers to (essentially) no one, where there are no rules, and where morals he thought he once had fell apart. Maybe, it is more the absence of \"civilization\" that leads to the \"civilization\" that encourages inhumane treatment. It is human nature that is at fault, not any individual or group. The encouragement of American society for Kurtz to act in this way also definitely had an effect on him, but this is also human nature in a way. Human nature includes the elite\u0027s love for power and their ability to send others off to do the dirty work as well as the quality of obedience in those \"others\". All of these are human biases, and it seems like only the people who have a great deal of self-awareness/control would be able to overcome them. Coppola\u0027s genius in Apocalypse Now encourages us to recognize that we all have darkness inside of us, but it is our ability to overcome this madness, even in the face of no authority or laws OR in the face of authority that is evidently incorrect, that is what matters. This movie, like Conrad\u0027s masterpiece, also raises the following questions: When to \"shield\" the truth? Who should do so? Does anyone have the right to do so? Should the public have full access to all knowledge? It makes sense to think that the general public is sometimes not in the position to make a good judgement call and that emotions would cloud our judgement. But this mindset is also dangerous for the people who ultimately make the call, as it places them on a pedestal that could then cloud their judgement. Hard question that we need to ask ourselves...\n\nThere are also apparent differences between Apocalypse Now and Heart of Darkness. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the British Empire stands firm, with Conrad seeming to respect the British Empire endlessly. With such a positive view of the motherland, the implications in Heart of Darkness in terms of England seem to be that all is not yet lost and there is some hope for mankind after all. The film is entirely different; after watching it and learning of the Vietnam war, few people would dare to advocate for the US as a solution to any problem today. This then leads us to the opposite conclusion: that America has absolutely no right to put itself on a pedestal that creates \u0027good\u0027 in the world. And of course, in today\u0027s view, this idea is much more realistic and applicable. I appreciate that Coppola urges his audience to recognize that America is not some heaven and also to look back on history and our mistakes. This movie was very well done, with aspects like sound and editing coming together to create a masterpiece, and raises difficult questions that we must ask ourselves.",

      "reviewBody": "It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o\u0027clock shadow looking like it\u0027s closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!\n\nWhhhoooooo!! I\u0027m left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.\n\nIndiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today\u0027s terms.\n\nRaiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy\u0027s battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. \" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. \" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) \" Truck? What truck?\" ( and then later ) \"Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar\u0027s. I\u0027m going after that truck. \"\n\nSola ) \" How? \" ( Indy ) I don\u0027t know I\u0027m making this up as I go.\"\n\nRaiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven\u0027t seen this movie in a while or if you haven\u0027t seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.\n\nTRUST ME",

      "reviewBody": "So the \"innovative\" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here\u0027s a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.\n\nHaving read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I\u0027d go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable. I couldn\u0027t be further from the truth. This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries. Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does. Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife. Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\n\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I\u0027m still not sure. This film noir concept shouldn\u0027t work, but it does so wonderfully.",

      "reviewBody": "I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like \"Sonnenallee\" or \"Good bye Lenin\" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of \"Mickey Mouse State\" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing \"Das Leben der Anderen\" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10.",

The actors were picked perfectly. The overall experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was a bit skeptical and thought I\u0027d end up leaving an hour into the movie (it\u0027s a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn\u0027t even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid to miss something. I\u0027m usually very particular about the movies, nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5. Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I\u0027ve done some more research on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this film!",

Paths of Glory does not portray war as conflict between armies or individual soldiers arrayed against one another on the battlefield. Nor does it portray the acts of great leaders and heroes of war. No this film takes a different tact. \n\nThe setting is the Western Front of 1916 in the trenches with French soldiers faced off against an invisible German force across a barren No Man\u0027s Land. The German\u0027s are never seen and the dramatic \"combat\" is between vain French officers as they vie for prestige and honors. The victims are the innocent French soldiers under their command who suffer miserably because of their arrogance and ignorance.\n\nBrilliant, gripping, and definitely a \"must see\".",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes all good horror needs is a good idea. But sometimes, rarely indeed, a horror masterpiece will reach us by the hand of a Kubrick, with the adept, elusive touch of a great artist to guide the vision, and we know what separates it from all else.\n\nOkay, the story has enough promise that even a hired gun would have to try to fail. Heck, even Stephen King himself didn\u0027t fare so bad. It\u0027s how Kubrick perceives King\u0027s universe however, how he fills the frame with it, that renders THE SHINING a feast for the senses.\n\nHorror that will reach us through the mind and body alike, an assault as it were, tending eventually its pitch to a crescendo, yet curiously not without a delicate lull.\n\nKubrick\u0027s cinema is, as usually, a sight to behold. We get the adventurous camera that prowls through the lavish corridors of the Overlook Hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration, linear tracking shots exposing impeccably decorated interiors in symmetric grandeur. The geometrical approach in how Kubrick perceives space reminds me very much of Japanese directors of some 10 years before. In that what is depicted in the frame, the elements of narrative, is borderline inconsequential to how they all balance and harmonize together.\n\nCertain images stand out in this. The first shot of Jack\u0027s typewriter, ominously accompanied by the off-screen thumps of a ball, drums of doom that seem to emanate from the very walls or the typewriter itself, an instrument of doom in itself as is later shown. A red river flowing through the hotel\u0027s elevators in a poetry of slow motions. Jack hitting the door with the axe, the camera moving along with him, tracking the action as it happens, as though it\u0027s the camera piercing through the door and not the axe. The ultra fast zoom in the kid\u0027s face violently thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his POV. And of course, the epochal bathroom scene.\n\nMuch has been said of Jack Nicholson\u0027s obtrusive overacting. His mad is not entirely successful, because, well, he\u0027s Jack Nicholson. The guy looks half-mad anyway. Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself. Shelley Duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices Kubrick ever made. Coming from a streak of fantastic performances for Robert Altman in the seventies (3 WOMEN, THIEVES LIKE US, NASHVILLE), she brings to her character the right amounts of swanlike fragility and emotional distress. A delicate, detached thing thrown in with the mad.",

Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid. I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it! But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

      "reviewBody": "In Hollywood of the 50\u0027s, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.\n\n\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched \"Sunset Boulevard\" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called \"Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back\" (a.k.a. \"The Making of Sunset Boulevard\" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Crepúsculo dos Deuses\" (\"Dusk of the Gods\")",

Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated.

      "reviewBody": "A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the \"anime\" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man\u0027s continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?",

And then I finally got to see \u0027Dr.Strangelove\u0027. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick\u0027s later works, there\u0027s a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I\u0027m guessing that Seller\u0027s love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

The original short story(rather unremarkable, actually)has been expanded into a magnificent example of Hollywood entertainment at its best. In addition to perhaps the finest line-up of character actors ever assembled(next to Cukor\u0027s David Copperfield, that is), we get Laughton and Dietrich at the top of their form. The person who criticised Lanchester\u0027s performance as \"annoying\" missed the point entirely. Miss Plimsoll is meant to be annoying! Also, what\u0027s with all the bad-mouthing of Tyrone Power? \"Hammy\"; \"terrible\"; \"worst performance ever\". These are the perceptive IMDb reviews? Only one of you got it right: it\u0027s hammy because Leonard Vole is the one acting, not Power! For 95% of the film, the character is dissembling, only showing his true colors at the end. Of course it looks hammy: Vole isn\u0027t a born actor like his wife. And to all those know-it-alls who called this film mediocre and predictable, I look forward to your upcoming film projects which I\u0027m sure will be paragons of excellence and worthy to be set alongside classics of the golden age.",

      "reviewBody": "This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it\u0027s still up there for one of their stronger movies. It\u0027s not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.\n\n TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie",

This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.",

      "reviewBody": "Over the years, this film has gained a near-mythological status: how Sergio Leone turned down \u0027The Godfather\u0027 to make this opus, his 16 years trying to get it made, the film\u0027s \u0027butchering\u0027 upon its North American release in 1984, Leone\u0027s \u0027broken heart\u0027 that led to his death just a few years later, etc. So, after reading a glowing review about a new, uncut version on DVD, I couldn\u0027t wait to rent the film.\n\nI wish I could say it was a masterpiece. Clunky dialogue, lousy acting, cardboard characters, a pompous, TV mini-series feel to the story, unbelievable situations all conspire to sink this movie under its own weight. \n\nOne of the problems seems to be that the script was written by Italians and then somehow translated into English by an American writer who must have a tin ear for dialogue. The actors, all of whom have been excellent elsewhere, are left to look foolish uttering the stuff. The only one who barely gets by is De Niro - we realize what a great actor he is since he makes the most what he\u0027s given, which ain\u0027t much. Poor James Woods, who has appointed himself the chief cheerleader for this film, leaves little scenery unchewed. The rest of the cast go from mediocre to embarrassing - even the lovely and talented Jennifer Connelly, who appears as the love interest as a child, does not escape unscathed.\n\nHaving said all that, I seem to be in the minority about this film. So go ahead and see it, if you must. Just don\u0027t mention it in the same breath as \u0027The Godfather\u0027.",

The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone\u0027s ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn\u0027t win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you\u0027re in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making.

      "reviewBody": "I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn\u0027t work that well. Then came Pixar with it\u0027s revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven\u0027t felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don\u0027t think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it\u0027s definitely up there among Pixar\u0027s finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll like it and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hug \u0027em all as soon as the credits roll.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you\u0027ve seen it, you know you\u0027ve seen something.\n\nA few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her \"typical teenager\" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari\u0027s character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His \"purpose\" in the film, unlike anyone else\u0027s, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to \"move\" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember.",

      "reviewBody": "Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man\u0027s conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It\u0027s understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it\u0027s a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it\u0027s duplistic and hypocritical for the film\u0027s haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino\u0027s Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert\u0027s history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland\u0027s independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It\u0027s beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner\u0027s score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn\u0027t one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson\u0027s best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it\u0027s over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "What impresses me the most about the film, as the title makes apparent, is that it\u0027s a German made film about a German U-boat. Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition (especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis), but these characters are so well developed and played like human-beings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.\n\nI love the flow and pacing of the Director\u0027s Cut; it takes its time, and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula \"first major plot point at minute 12\" cookie-cutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters, discover how they kill time while waiting for orders, how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts: how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater, how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should, the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them, and dozens of little personality quirks--subtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew, and I\u0027m interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.\n\nThe underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.\n\nAnd despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it\u0027s a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.\n\nJurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I\u0027ve ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he\u0027s forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.\n\nThe rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film\u0027s characters and their portrayals. It\u0027s both disappointing and satisfying that I\u0027m not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I\u0027ve reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these \"heroes\", the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.\n\nAnother aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these \"talked about\" scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.\n\nI can go on for a long while: Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances, a sparse but great score (this film\u0027s lack of music is quite appropriate, making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places). Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said, I can go on for awhile but I\u0027ll sum it up and end this review with one statement: Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.",

What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",

      "reviewBody": "High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff\u0027s ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there\u0027s usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people). \n\nHere he finds a middle ground- the story is taken from a hard-boiled detective novel, the kind you could probably buy for a quarter or fifty cents in the old days- as he tells of two stories interconnected at the hip, both with detail a commercial Hollywood director would brush off. The first is of businessman Gondo (Toshiro Mifune, with his usual bravura presence, but with enough nuanced and quiet moments for two movies), who is about to close a deal to get the shoe company he\u0027s worked for for years, when he gets a phone call. There\u0027s been a kidnapping- not his son, but his chauffeur\u0027s by default. Backed into a corner without options, he gets together 30 million he really can\u0027t afford, and gives it to the kidnapper(s). The police, meanwhile, are not about to give up, and start digging for clues with an in-depth investigation that goes to probe every possibility: the chauffeur\u0027s son used as a partial witness with drawings; a car; a trolly car; all this leads to nothing and everything, leading to a third act that\u0027s as riveting as the first two.\n\nAlthough the acting by everyone involved, cop characters included (Tatsuya Nakadai and Yutaka Sada are surprisingly good, the later even with limited screen time), Kurosawa keeps the film deliberately paced. Another director (more modern perhaps, but maybe not) might cut to the chase quicker, cutting past most of the investigation details, and even the emotional high-points in the first act. But Kurosawa is as interested in the nature and details of what the police do as he is with the compositions, which are constructed and framed as only an artist would do. The film creates a superb juxtaposition as well- Mifune\u0027s Gondo is enraged about what will happen with his money, but his morals stand above everything in his business affairs. Meanwhile, the cops here aren\u0027t cruel and unforgiving, but professionals trying to crack a case that the audience can hang onto. And then when the \"seedy\" underbelly of the city comes into view, it\u0027s looked on with at least some compassion by Kurosawa, and it\u0027s not too over-the-top.\n\nIf all your looking for is thrill after thrill, like in Sanjuro or even Hidden Fortress, look elsewhere- the violence, by the way, is kept to a low level for this one (it\u0027d even be quite suitable for kids, if they don\u0027t mind the subtitles and quintessential intensity in the Japanese style of film acting). But for tight, often gripping suspense in the IL\u0027 \u0027whodunit\u0027 mystery tale, this is a keeper. Manipulative, perhaps, yet in the hands of a master it\u0027s an exemplary deal. And, in the end, it even provides a sad, existential kind of conclusion as good and evil become blurred as the kidnapper looks through glass at the disillusioned Gondo. It\u0027s one of the great endings in world cinema. A+",

      "reviewBody": "How many times has there been a movie you could really relate to? How many times has it happened that you\u0027ve seen a character on the screen that reminds of something that you\u0027ve been through in your life? As I saw Ishan (Darsheel Safary) today, I felt, somewhere deep within that that\u0027s me.\n\nNotwithstanding the slight retard nature, dyslexia and bad academic performance, the character of Ishan really made me remember my childhood today. I remember I was something like him as a child.creative and imaginative. And my imagination always went unappreciated. I used to curate gibberish  just like he did. I painted, I dreamed and I fantasized about different things. So I feel writer Amol Gupte and director Aamir Khan (what a wonderful debut!) have picked an incredibly moving story. Frankly, I am not easily moved by movies. Not even the greatest tearjerkers have managed to \"move\" me, but for a moment I was stunned. Is this really happening to me? Am I trying to cry? In fact, the scene where Ram (Aamir Khan) walks into Ishan\u0027s room and discovers a score of sketches and drawings, it made me feel like somebody had in fact, opened my closet and discovered my secret childhood fantasies (Believe me, I still have them.) This movie will surely engage all those who have had similar incidents in their lives. That\u0027s for sure. I am moved. I love this film. I don\u0027t know and I don\u0027t care how this film does in the box office but let me tell you don\u0027t watch this film if you\u0027re looking for regular boy meets girl story. Don\u0027t even skip this film thinking it\u0027s children\u0027s movie  no it isn\u0027t. In fact, Taare Zameen Par is a movie potentially targeted towards parents. But if you think you too have undergone similar childhood conflicts and lived a life where the people around you refuse to appreciate your fantasies, then definitely go for it. TZP mirrors many of those people\u0027s lives that looks just plain and simple but those who compromised their dreams for the sake of the earthly existence.\n\nOkay, enough of fantasies. Technically, writer Amol Gupte delivers an A Grade script. Aamir Khan shows his talent not just as an actor but a very versatile and intelligent. Oscar Wilde, Leonardo da Vinci and Sally Gardner were hardly ever heard of in Hindi cinema before this. The writer just does not deliver a well written script but also his knowledge of research (which other filmmakers hardly ever do!) Musically, it\u0027s two-thumbs up for Shanker Ehsaan Loy. The title song is fascinating. Maa and Jame Raho combine talents in all respects- music, words and voice. The production design is superb. Not for a moment you feel anything is fake. They even managed to squeeze in some quick visual effects and animated scenes. They\u0027re there to add another dimension to great story telling. The casting is good and well justified. Little Darsheel steals the show. Tisca Chopra grabs attention.\n\nAamir Khan, however stuns the audience by appearing at almost near half of the film. That\u0027s the surprise but you don\u0027t miss Aamir in the first half because Darsheel will definitely grab your attention and Aamir gets to show some good directorial talent.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027d say go and watch the film. I wouldn\u0027t recommend if you\u0027re addicted to Yashraj stuffs but if you really want to see some intelligent film-making, then Taare Zameen Par is a treat.",

      "reviewBody": "Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.\n\nNone of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.\n\nAnother nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.\n\nIn the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",

      "reviewBody": "The unseen star of this film is the Academy of St Martin\u0027s in the Field, London. Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart\u0027s music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.\n\nBut beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer\u0027s portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart\u0027s personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart\u0027s sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart\u0027s brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.\n\nAnother unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.\n\nThis film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart\u0027s life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart\u0027s music. If you have not yet done so, see it.",

      "reviewBody": "The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying \"Wheres all the violence\", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.\n\nThis is one of the movies I don\u0027t get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: \"Are you gonna bark all day...\", \"I\u0027ll make you my dog\u0027s bitch\". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don\u0027t know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there\u0027s a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino\u0027s best movie. I didn\u0027t care much for the \"Kill Bill\" movies, but who cares, I\u0027m not reviewing them.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now.",

I think it\u0027s a pity that certain critics, specially in Italy, are determined to transform this clever pulp director into some kind of god. Maybe, partly, because Tarantino has been very clever, elevating some of the Italian pulp movies of the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s to a sort of cult status. Italy is very grateful for that, he\u0027s rewarded with interminable praise. I fear that\u0027s the wrong approach, it\u0027s also confusing. He makes popcorn movies, brilliantly. The characters have never anything important to say, Burger King, Superman, that\u0027s the extent of its depth and I think he\u0027s tapping into a society that\u0027s getting shallower and shallower with every passing year. But, if I\u0027m mentioning this instead of talking about all the great things I could be saying about his movie is because there is a strange force trying to brain wash me into believing that Tarantino is the most important influence in movies since time immemorial. No, he\u0027s a great director of inconsequential fun movies. I consider myself a fan and I intend to see all his future movies. This one has some wonderful touches, winking at other movies by John Sturges, Robert Aldrich etc. Brad Pitt and in particular Christoph Waltz give wonderful performances. Waltz is at the center of my favorite scenes in the film. Enjoy this movies for what it is and not for what critics are saying it is. You\u0027ll enjoy it even more that way.",

      "reviewBody": "A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.\n\nThe fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn\u0027t even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.\n\nMatt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will\u0027s talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will\u0027s intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.\n\nYes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.\n\nThe writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt\u0027s best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet\u0027s Society.\n\nIf your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it\u0027s time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.\n\nThis one is a keeper in my movie library.",

      "reviewBody": "Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species. For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as \"boring\" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.\n\nThankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick\u0027s accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in \"science fiction\", and its depiction of space travel and mankind\u0027s future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn\u0027t caught up.\n\n2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film\u0027s greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn\u0027t made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that\u0027s just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can\u0027t work out how some of the shots were done. The film\u0027s only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind\u0027s technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick\u0027s.\n\nBesides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that\u0027s the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it\u0027s up to the audience to continue. There\u0027s no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that\u0027s what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn\u0027t going to let us off so lightly.\n\nI\u0027m glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",

Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I\u0027ve never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :) You want to look away, but cannot.\n\nThis movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the \u0027slasher flick\u0027, this stuff is REAL.\n\nIn a country amid a \u0027war against drugs\u0027 this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government \"task-force\" or classroom lecture.",

      "reviewBody": "I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock\u0027s greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it\u0027s very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and \u0027Vertigo\u0027, though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic \u0027Rear Window\u0027 a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in \u0027Vertigo\u0027 and is jaw-droppingly good. It\u0027s difficult to remember now that \u0027Vertigo\u0027 is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart\u0027s intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. \u0027Vertigo\u0027 is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak (\u0027The Man With The Golden Arm\u0027) in a role that she will always be remembered for. \u0027Vertigo\u0027 is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",

      "name": "Influential and unforgettable masterpiece.",
      "reviewBody": "Fritz Lang\u0027s highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany, where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement, and ended in the United States in 1953 with the production of The Big Heat, a film noir classic. Perhaps his greatest film, M (Germany, 1931) forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir. Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones. \n\nEven though M was Lang\u0027s (and Germany\u0027s) first sound film, many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late 1920\u0027s. While most early \"talkies\" return films to their static, visually monotonous, stage- imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium, M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous, off-screen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue. The film\u0027s editing, particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting, also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling. Of course, many of the film\u0027s sound effects are also imaginative and memorable, none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film\u0027s central character, the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert (magnificently played by Peter Lorre). \n\nSound is also an important contributor to M\u0027s rich and influential use of off screen space. One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster, creepily intoning to his next victim, Elsie Beckmann, \"You have a very pretty ball.\" Not only is Beckert\u0027s shadow a bow toward Lang\u0027s expressionist artistic roots, but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image - that is, among us, the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuous-appearing, albeit monstrous, member. Another example of Lang\u0027s use of off-screen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsie\u0027s absence from them: an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table, the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsie\u0027s mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughter\u0027s arrival, the attic play area that awaits Elsie\u0027s return from school. Most memorable of all - and most often alluded to visually in other films - is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckert\u0027s assault and murder of the innocent child, representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsie\u0027s ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame. Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated images.\n\nBeyond its technical brilliance, the keys to M\u0027s lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckert\u0027s twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and \"trial.\" Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer, Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath. Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear-cut. To be sure, the gut-reaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who, beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry, capture Beckert and bring him to a mock- formal trial whose conclusion is foregone. Like many in America today, Beckert\u0027s accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the \"monster\" in the surest way possible: a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible. \n\nConsidering the heinousness of Beckert\u0027s crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again, this emotional response is hard to resist. Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism - quite the contrary. Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckert\u0027s unkempt \"court appointed\" defense attorney and Beckert\u0027s own impassioned monologue, Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others (guilty or not) in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in 1930s Germany. That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks, dresses, and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident. Moreover, the letter \"M\" chalked on Beckert\u0027s back by one of his pursuers not only stands for \"murderer\" but also alludes to God\u0027s marking of Cain. While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil, it in fact represents God\u0027s warning to Cain\u0027s flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance, but to leave justice in God\u0027s hands. Translated into secular terms (and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame), God\u0027s hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert \"in the name of the Law.\"",

      "reviewBody": "\"How happy is the blameless vestal\u0027s lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray\u0027r accepted, and each wish resign\u0027d.\" - Alexander Pope\n\nMichel Gondry\u0027s \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man behind \"Being John Malkovich.\"\n\nThe film was produced by Focus Features (\"Lost in Translation,\" \"21 Grams\"), a company which strives to offer original, quality films to the true cinema lovers. If the company keeps producing films this good, they may become hugely successful in the future, if not already.\n\nThe previews portrayed the movie as a bouncy, cheery comedy in the vein of \"Adaptation,\" the last film written for the big screen by Charlie Kaufman, when it is really a tender movie about love and romance. This is Jim Carrey\u0027s best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career. No snippy quotes, outrageous humor or bizarre antics in \"Sunshine\" -- Carrey plays a true, realistic, three-dimensional character named Joel Barrish, who plans to have memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before. Joel meets with the company\u0027s founder, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and is informed that the procedure -- although \"technically\" brain damage -- is on par with a heavy night of drinking. \"Nothing you\u0027ll miss much,\" he is told, as he plunges into a bizarre world of long forgotten memories.\n\nThe entire process of the operation is quite fascinating, really, if a bit reminiscent of an idea founded by none other than one of Kaufman\u0027s favorite writers, Philip K. Dick, who wrote the source short story for the Ah-nuld movie \"Total Recall.\" All items relating to the person you want erased from your brain are assembled together, and the technicians at Lacuna (Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) then \"map\" an outline of your memories, which are supposedly stemmed together. I have my doubts about the seriousness and remote possibility of such a procedure being performed, and the explanation is quite simply utter bull, but we don\u0027t care because the entire erasing of Joel\u0027s memories serves as a backdrop for a deeper meaning: If you could forget about past romances, would you really want to? And if so, would you be willing to sacrifice all the good ones, along with the bad ones?\n\nThe conclusion that \"Sunshine\" arrives at is, to be totally truthful, as honest as can be. During the procedure, Joel\u0027s subconscious realizes that it doesn\u0027t want to let go of its memories of Clementine, and so begins a strange labyrinth of fragmented memories, constantly changing surroundings, and mental materializations of Clementine. The movie is like a very bizarre dream, when you\u0027re trying to interact with people, but they\u0027re not responding, and you shout and try to get their attention but they don\u0027t seem to notice. Joel\u0027s entire odyssey of the interior of his mind makes \"Being John Malkovich\" look normal -- but as I didn\u0027t like \"Malkovich\" very much, and thought its strangeness was unjustified, it fits perfectly in \"Sunshine\" -- there are some great special effects, such as when Joel is wandering through his own memories, drifting in and out of sleep, hearing the voices of the technicians erasing his memories and watching as objects and areas around him vanish and deconstruct. It\u0027s so bizarre but yet also so beautiful. Gondry was a former music video director (his complete works are available on DVD) and he is the perfect candidate for this project, having worked with Kaufman before on the 2001 flop \"Human Nature.\" It seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the movie.\n\nThere is a very deep message in \"Sunshine,\" and it is arguably Kaufman\u0027s deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent. I saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening I attended. It tanked in the US and I predict it will do the same in the UK, which is a shame, because this is the smartest film of 2004 and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year. While everyone flocks to see the new Denzel Washington action movie, \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is forgotten, which is quite depressing -- people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its core.\n\nI think what the movie finally asks us after its long, emotional journey, is would we want our own memories erased? And if so, what would the consequences be? A lesser film might examine this idea poorly -- \"Sunshine\" is not. It is perfect in almost every conceivable way, and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking -- in my entire lifetime, this is one of the most unique film experiences I have ever had.\n\n\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It\u0027s beautiful, it\u0027s bizarre, it\u0027s exceptional, it\u0027s funny, it\u0027s lovely, it\u0027s touching, it\u0027s witty, and it\u0027s one of the best movies I have ever seen.",

      "reviewBody": "OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.\n\nOn the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today\u0027s standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today\u0027s world.\n\nMy advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don\u0027t agree with AFI\u0027s number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is.",

The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn\u0027t take one side over another, making the point that there isn\u0027t really any \"bad guys\" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I\u0027ve seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?",

      "reviewBody": "SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80\u0027s ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford\u0027s novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins \u0026 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. \n\nA superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick\u0027s brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D\u0027Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.\n\nThe film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It\u0027s the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to \"weed out all non-hackers\". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes \"Joker\" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes \"Cowboy\" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes \"Gomer Pyle\" (Vincent D\u0027Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman\u0027s brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. \"Joker\" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman\u0027s head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself. \n\nThe second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman\u0027s camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy\u0027s Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.\n\nThe film is Staney Kubrick\u0027s best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80\u0027s, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there\u0027s excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined \"hours of boredom, seconds of terror\" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen\u0027s of body\u0027s out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city\u0027s are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn\u0027t even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show. \n\n\u0027Born to Kill\u0027 - written on Joke\u0027s helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the \"duality of Man\" according to Jung. 10/10",

      "name": "I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.",
      "reviewBody": "Its Hitch\u0027s most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else\u0027s crime.\n\nI\u0027ve finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!\n\nIf you said to Hitchcock \"as if he\u0027d keep driving\" or \"as if she\u0027d do that\" - he would just laugh at you and say you\u0027ve missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you\u0027ll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone\u0027s been stabbed.\n\nIt flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.\n\nA succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann\u0027s essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "I would say that the movie is really a gem of an art piece. The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.\n\nThe director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer\u0027s emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.\n\nAnother glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and \"programmed\" to choose only good, he wasn\u0027t accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word \"Ourange\" that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.\n\nThe artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.\n\nFor the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of \"programming\" them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through.",

      "reviewBody": "Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, \"SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND! WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!\" What do you think would happen? Snatch is what happens.\n\nSnatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie. Let me repeat that. This movie is crazy! Imagine the Mr. Toad\u0027s Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend. Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.\n\nThe movie has it\u0027s problems. First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch\u0027s predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes. The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater. I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn\u0027t last.\n\nIf any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can. Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it\u0027s funny, you\u0027ll laugh till your lungs burst. It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same \"slamming victim\u0027s head in a car door\" act again. The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack. I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn\u0027t have a bigger role. I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he\u0027s not.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie\u0027s style. I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp. That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock. If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.\n\n9/10",

      "reviewBody": "Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous. His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.\n\nIn one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.\n\nHere, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires: to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn\u0027t got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child\u0027s mother.\n\nFlash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.\n\nHowever, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in. It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh, sometimes in the same scene. This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it.",

One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family. Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief\u0027, Vittorio de Sica\u0027s gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work. \n\nde Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs. The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true. The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again. \n\n`The Bicycle Thief\u0027 personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life. While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important. `The Bicycle Thief\u0027 has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.\n\n--Shelly",

Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it\u0027s a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they\u0027re referring to.\n\nThe star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O\u0027Connor makes the most of his \"second banana\" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break into films. \n\nThe three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly\u0027s \"Singin\u0027 in the Rain\" classic; all three in the \"Good Mornin\u0027\" number; O\u0027Connor\u0027s \"Make \u0027Em Laugh\"; and Kelly and Reynolds in \"You Were Meant for Me.\" The masterpiece however may be the \"Gotta Dance\" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charissejust perfect. Also great fun are O\u0027Connor and Kelly in \"Fit as a Fiddle\" and \"Moses Supposes.\"\n\nThere are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood\u0027s race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the \"Beautiful Girl\" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. \n\nJean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.\n\nThe great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly \"lip syncing\" for Hagen, it\u0027s really Hagen\u0027s voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the \"I Would, Would You\" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing \"Singin\u0027 in the Rain\" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can\u0027t tell who is lip syncing whose voice.\n\nLots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen\u0027s Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It\u0027s also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams \"I LOVE YOU\" it\u0027s a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman\u0027s diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.\n\nA great film!",

      "reviewBody": "\"Scarface\" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.\n\nIt has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind \u0027The Godfather\u0027.\n\nBut it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like \u0027The Godfather\u0027 or \u0027Goodfellas\u0027. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as \"tackiness\" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the \"remake\"! \n\nAl Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana\u0027s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn\u0027t really think much and gets angry all the time!\n\nThere is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including \u0027Gina and Elvira\u0027s theme\u0027, \u0027Push it to the limit\u0027 and the title track instrumental.\n\nThere are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony\u0027s visit to his mother\u0027s.\n\nAbout the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what \"Scarface\" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn\u0027t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn\u0027t be as effective without him!\n\nSteven Bauer shines as Tony\u0027s friend Manny.\n\nRobert Loggia is wonderful as Tony\u0027s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.\n\nThen there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.\n\nThe director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\n\n\"Scarface\" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",

An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. \n\nYou actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis\u0027s mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. \n\nThis film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle \u0027You talking to me? Well I\u0027m the only one here.\u0027 and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it\u0027s finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh \u0026 gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. \n\nThis is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70\u0027s. An unsettling gem of a film. \n\n5/5",

      "reviewBody": "To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.\n\nThis movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!\n\nCompared to most other films \"Amelie\" (and I will stick to \"Amelie\" since \"Le Fabuleux destin d\u0027Amélie Poulain\" is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.\n\nDirector Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing \"Amelie\" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us \"Alien 4\" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful \"Delicatessen\" in 1991.\n\nAudrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry \"Amelie\" solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.\n\nI could go on forever about \"Amelie\". It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, \"Amelie\" made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.\n\nI very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",

Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O\u0027Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027m going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O\u0027Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O\u0027Toole\u0027s eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a \"silly movie\" Wow, I had Michael Apted\u0027s quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don\u0027t know what he meant. I love this film.",

When Luther is murdered, Hooker goes on the run and seeks out Luther\u0027s old friend Henry Gondorff to help him put together a major sting to take revenge on Lonnegan. However with so much heat on Hooker and the stakes so high can they pull it off and get away clean?\n\nAlmost a follow up to Butch and Sundance, this film partners the stars of the day Newman and Redford to good effect. The story is a little less fun but still very enjoyable to watch as it builds to a great finale. The use of chapters ran the risk of fragmenting the film into bits but instead it really helps set it out and makes it more manageable. Although it is not as light hearted and jovial as the theme music suggests it still manages to flow nicely with the slightly darker drama not spoiling anything but only serving to make it feel more grown up.\n\nThe cast are all very good and make the film easy to watch. Redford comes off the best in terms of characters and his role really suits both his carefree attitude (the start of the film) but also his more serious side (the rest of the film). Newman has a lesser role that perhaps doesn\u0027t suit him quite as well, but he does have several really good scenes (the hustles) where he does very good work. Shaw\u0027s accent is a little heavy at first but I got used to it and it worked for me and he was a really good foil for Redford/Newman. The support cast including Durning, Walston, Gould, Jones and others all do good work.\n\nThe direction and use of music is really good and the sense of period is well crafted and doesn\u0027t just feel like it was painted on. I\u0027m not sure if it deserved Best Picture or not because I don\u0027t know what the rest of the field was for that year but it is a really enjoyable film that is quite fun to watch several times even 30 years later  and isn\u0027t that the main thing?",

      "name": "Early science fiction story that presents a pessimistic prediction of a future society.",
      "reviewBody": "Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the 1920s? Sure, some science fiction movies are huge today, such as George Lucas\u0027 latest goofy Star Wars movie, but in 1926, Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then. And sure enough, we went right ahead living the way we were living, the population got bigger and more crowded, and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis. \n\nThe story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society (Metropolis) was run by his father, John Frederson, the master of Metropolis. He lives in a Pleasure Garden\u0027 high above the level of the workers\u0027, and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father, given the terrible conditions under which they live and work. Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines, showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic, sinister looking machine. The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts, as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devil-looking monster. After countless workers are consumed by it (no wonder this was Hitler\u0027s favorite film), they are immediately replaced by other workers, who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements. If some of these scenes, men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured, and the rest of the workers keep right on working, hardly even noticing.\n\nThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film, as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions. When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines, Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable, but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city. This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny, and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated. `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups\u0027 is a saying that doesn\u0027t necessarily only apply to stupid people, as Metropolis suggests. Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue, and the result is still compelling today. The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways (except that the two films can hardly be compared)  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least. An excellent film, Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten.",

      "reviewBody": "Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life\u0027s limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely \u0027hero\u0027 of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it\u0027s all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed \u0027The Mummy\u0027 by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he\u0027s learned that his life has a limit; it\u0027s time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.\n\nIkiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it\u0027s a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as \u0027our hero\u0027 throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I\u0027ve mentioned, he\u0027s probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that\u0027s just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn\u0027t want to be useless anymore. That\u0027s why he\u0027s \u0027our hero\u0027. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he\u0027s on screen - we\u0027re sorry that he\u0027s wasted his life, and we\u0027re sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it\u0027s easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.\n\nIt could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it\u0027s final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn\u0027t work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you\u0027ve seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.",

      "reviewBody": "Leone\u0027s \u0027A Fistful Of Dollars\u0027 is a bona fide western classic, but amazingly he managed to top himself with this \"sequel\". Yeah, I know it isn\u0027t REALLY a sequel. In fact Leone\u0027s \"Dollars\" trilogy actually have no connection with each other, and Eastwood\u0027s so-called \"Man With No Name\" actually has many! (In this movie Monco, in the previous one Joe). Most people seem go for \u0027The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\u0027 as the best of the three movies, but I think \u0027For A Few Dollars More\u0027 just beats it. Anyway, there\u0027s no argument that they are three brilliant films, Eastwood is super cool in all of them, Leone is on top form, particularly in this one, and Ennio Morricone\u0027s scores are amazing stuff. \u0027For A Few Dollars More\u0027 is helped enormously by Lee Van Cleef playing Colonel Mortimer, and the scenes between him and Eastwood, and the ones between him and Klaus Kinski are pure gold. This is not only one of the best westerns ever made, but one of the best movies of any genre released in the 1960s. It was also a highly influential one. I can\u0027t imagine Peckinpah\u0027s \u0027The Wild Bunch\u0027 for example existing without Leone. Words fail me praising movies as brilliant as this one. All I can say is WATCH IT NOW. Or if you\u0027ve already seen it WATCH IT AGAIN!",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027m an Iranian, but I\u0027ve never been interested in Iranian cinema. I only watch Iranian films when they win awards or receive international recognition. I\u0027m a fan of Kiarostami and Majidi, but I can\u0027t really say that I like all of their films. I watched Farhady\u0027s previous film (About Elly) about a year ago, and the first thing which struck me was how culturally detached the movie was in its depiction of an event. At the time, I believed this to have been the cause of this director\u0027s success. Watching Nader and Simin, however, proved that I was terribly mistaken.\n\nAsghar Farhady\u0027s obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The life-like depiction of the Iranian courtroom (which is in no way impartial) places the audience in the Judge\u0027s seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up his/her mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay, I\u0027m almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life, because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events, so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.\n\nDespite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture (the sanctity of Family, faith, commitment towards parents and married life), I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke (although I\u0027m pretty sure it won\u0027t be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons).\n\nAfter seeing About Elly, I thought Farhady\u0027s success was just a one-time fling, but coming out of the theater, having watched Nader and Simin, I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.",

Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor\u0027s Brigid O\u0027Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.\n\nI personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them.

      "reviewBody": "Jack Lemmon is the man.\n\nThe Apartment really surprised me. The Best Picture winner starts off right in the middle of the action, but yet the first hour seems long and overrun. Too much time seems spent in trying to develop the characters (and oh so many of them) and not enough time is spent on just seeing what will happen. Just when I was about to lose faith, the film picks it up like I have never seen before. The whole sub-plot of the four guys wanting to use Lemmon\u0027s apartment for their evening tyrsts is dropped and Wilder smartly concentrates on Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray and the film creates true magic.\n\nThe Apartment is more of a drama than a comedy and balances the two elements perfectly. Just after one of the more dramatic moments of the film, we see Lemmon straining his pasta with a tennis racquet. The use of the doctor and his wife in supporting roles are completely there for comedy and yet add so much to the film. The ending also rates up there with the best of all time using an old device that doesn\u0027t seem at all cliched in this film. Some say that \"Some like it hot\" was Wilder\u0027s best, but now I have to disagree. The Apartment is better and surely would have made my top ten had the first hour not been so predictable.\n\nHow Jack Lemmon didn\u0027t win Best Actor is beyond me. His is a great performance, getting to act on more than one scale. MacMurray, another Wilder favourite is perfectly cast in the role of a family-wrecker. I wish they would have put a scene in which his wife confronts him with \"The News\". MacLaine glows on the screen even when she is sick and in bed.\n\nI fully recommend this film to all, it being Wilder\u0027s best makes it a must see.\n\n8/10 stars.",

The wrangling of legal points and the investigation into the truth just gets my cinematic blood pumping (I s\u0027pose it\u0027s in response to my own dashed hopes of becoming an attorney).\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" rises to the top of the pile easily.\n\nYes, the courtroom proceedings are nail-bitingly engaging. But played out against the tapestry of bigotry and hate make the legal goings-on even more compelling.\n\nThe writing here is so beautiful, so lyric, so poetic. The Harper Lee-based screenplay captures wonderfully a time and a place that are absolutely real--where big brothers could solve the universe\u0027s problems in an instant and all the treasures of the world could be contained in a cigar box.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" also contains three of the most impressive child performances I have ever witnessed--there\u0027s not a false or affected moment in any one of them. Until seeing \"Ponette,\" a movie I would highly recommend, the kids in \"Mockingbird\" received my best child performance ever awards. \"Ponette\" has ratcheted them down one notch, but that doesn\u0027t diminish the achievement here. The scene in which Scout dispels the mob simply by identifying its individual members is one of the most powerful moments in filmdom.\n\nPeck more than deserved his best actor nod. His quiet dignity is a definite asset. Brock Peters, too, is terrific in what could have been a cliched role.\n\nIf you are a moviegoer who has a bias against black and white movies and who has therefore never seen \"Mockingbird,\" I pity you.

This film is revealing a great Director, especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.\n\nDespite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan\u0027s landscape especially with the film\u0027s photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region\u0027s sub-conscious.\n\nVilleneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.\n\nThis has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.",

      "reviewBody": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. \n\nI loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy\u0027s dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit \u0026 charm along with Indy\u0027s usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn\u0027t by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix\u0027 laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.\n\nThis is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg\u0027s output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn\u0027t mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. \n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There\u0027s a bit of kissing/banter, and it\u0027s implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there\u0027s ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn\u0027t need another sequel after third release. There\u0027s nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy\u0027s Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it\u0027s up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.\n\nThe chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

      "reviewBody": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young \"wilderness explorer\" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.\n\nThe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.\n\nComing off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.\n\nWhat makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a \"bird\" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl\u0027s backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.\n\nBut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up\u0027s favour.\n\nBut of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl\u0027s facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).\n\nI cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.\n\n10/10.",

      "reviewBody": "One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann\u0027s main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro\u0027s tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he\u0027s stuck in a life of crime he doesn\u0027t want to lead. Pacino\u0027s cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n\u0027 robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Rashomon\" was Akira Kurosawa\u0027s first national hit (becoming, at the time, the highest-grossing foreign film in America) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but almost sixty years later it still hasn\u0027t lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn\u0027t a movie where you say, \"Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it\u0027s done in all the movies.\" Kurosawa\u0027s techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, \"Basic,\" which copies a good portion of \"Rashomon\u0027s\" concept. Which is the better film? It\u0027s not a hard choice.\n\nThe film begins under a structure which reads \"Rashomon\" on its exterior, in a small Japanese village. It\u0027s raining outside and a woodcutter (Takashi Shumura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner (Kichijiro Ueda), and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know -- of a brutal murder a few days prior.\n\nKurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event -- the slaying of an innocent man (the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshirô Mifune) in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer, the wife of the victim, and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man.\n\n\"Rashomon\" is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash, but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point (he uses a good deal of it in \"Ikiru\") but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story, not provide an easy solution to all the problems.\n\nIs there resolution in the finale of \"Rashomon\"? To a degree. But, like \"Ikiru,\" it also leaves an open answer to its audience -- this film questions us, and our humanity, and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good, and in my opinion the message of \"Rashomon\" is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting.",

      "reviewBody": "John McTiernan\u0027s second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. \n\nIt differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice.\n\nThe plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis\u0027s John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De\u0027Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture.\n\nThe good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont\u0027s photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste\u0027s stunning editing, Michael Kamen\u0027s great music and Richard Edlund\u0027s brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.\n\nOverall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.",

Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.\n\nKurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there\u0027s a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.\n\nA wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!",

      "name": "The Batman film I\u0027ve been waiting for...",
      "reviewBody": "Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by \u0027Forever\u0027 and \u0027Batman and Robin\u0027. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.\n\nThankfully though, Nolan has gone back to the roots of the character, portraying a confused and angry Bruce Wayne, who ultimately rises to become Gotham\u0027s greatest champion. Don\u0027t expect to see loads of shots of Batman in this film though. It is the story of Wayne and focuses mainly on his years of training and preparation for becoming Batman. You are almost teased throughout the first half of the movie, waiting to see the excellent Christian Bale in the costume, as it keeps holding back to keep you in anticipation. When Batman does finally turn up on screen, it is well worth the wait. In my opinion, Bale was born for this role and for the first time when watching a Batman film, I enjoyed the scenes of Wayne being Wayne as much as Wayne being Batman.\n\nOne of the strongest features of the film, is the way that it manges to suck you in believe that a \u0027Batman\u0027 could be a reality one day. The technology is current, with no use of silly OTT weapons and gadgets, again making the film work by today\u0027s standards. Plus, we are not allowed to forget that Batman is still just a man under the costume and there are times when he gets a bit of a kicking and shows that he can be vulnerable too, something we sometimes forget when watching a superhero flick. Gone too, are the silly villains!!! Jack Nicholson was the perfect Joker but from there it went downhill. Thankfully, in this movie the bad guys are actually fairly \u0027normal\u0027 and manage to be menacing at the same time.\n\nWhich finally brings me to the cast. I always had high expectations for this film when the cast was announced. Let\u0027s face it, what a line up! Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katy Holmes, Ken Watanabe and Tom Wilkinson are not to be sniffed at. Even an old favourite of mine makes an appearance: Rutger Hauer! Awesome. Actors of this calibre would never have gotten involved in this project if they didn\u0027t have faith in Christoper Nolan\u0027s talents and thankfully they took the leap...\n\nFor the comic book fans out there, waiting to see this movie, let me assure you that you won\u0027t be upset. Imagine the darkness of the \u0027A Death In The Family\u0027 and the \u0027Year One\u0027 story lines. I have never met a fan of Batman who didn\u0027t love these books. Well, this is the kind of Batman you can expect from Bale: Dark, brooding and tortured by his past, yet the hero we have come to love. For those of you who are not comic fans, then just look forward to seeing how Batman should be. This film is a credit to Bob Kane\u0027s original vision and a testament to all the talented artists and writers who keep the legend of the Dark Knight alive in the comic books today....\n\nThank you Mr. Nolan and thank you Mr. Bale. In fact thanks to everyone who worked on this film. Batman finally Begins from here....",

Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we\u0027re not there yet but that we are on our way.

      "reviewBody": "Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful \u0027Das Experiment\u0027 has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or \u0027The Downfall\u0027 to give it it\u0027s English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I\u0027ve ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man\u0027s every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.\n\nIt is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang\u0027s main claim to greatness, however - it\u0027s the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you\u0027re watching you can not only see what\u0027s happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there\u0027s always the notion that a nation is falling. That\u0027s another thing that\u0027s great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we\u0027re watching this almost great nation crumble around it\u0027s leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi\u0027s; but Der Untergang has managed even that. \u0027The Downfall\u0027 is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man\u0027s huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed.",

Back in those days, my grandpop was excited to see both his fav film stars, Eastwood n Hackman in the same film. The cast is awesomely strong. Eastwood, Hackman n Freeman. This aint just a great Western. Its a great movie with awesome characters. Eastwood playing a tough guy who has killed women and children in the past but trying to lead a decent honest life with his kids on a farm. He has become more weaker with age. His farm is going thru a loss n he is pulled into his darker side once again. On the other side v have Hackman as a sheriff whos against people carrying guns in his town. He is a bit autocratic n sadist when meting out punishment. We have Freeman as Eastwood\u0027s old pal who during a shootout acknowledges that he aint no ruthless anymore. All the performances r top notch. Eastwood\u0027s direction is truly mesmerizing from opening shot n the editing top notch. The one liners are also memorable. Cinematography by Jack N Green is wonderful. The film begins and ends with a beautiful wide shot, Eastwood standing at the grave near a tree, with a sunset in the background. As a fan of Eastwood n western genre, i owed it myself to write a review of this film.",

      "reviewBody": "............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nIt\u0027s easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of \"Children of Heaven\". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I\u0027m sure others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! \n\nAfter watching \"Children\", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn\u0027t like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines, regrettably, seem rather empty, almost laughable in comparison. \n\nThe fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review such as this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. \n\nI feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed, more often than not, as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate. \n\nSome have commented that \"Children\" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.\n\n10*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com",

      "reviewBody": "Come and See , well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child\u0027s perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.\n\n I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.\n\nThe acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you\u0027d expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you\u0027ll have to see.\n\nCome and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Movies should be like amusement parks\" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said \"People should go to them to have fun\". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you\u0027re constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you\u0027re least expecting it you\u0027re hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you\u0027ll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it\u0027s hilarious! \n\nAfter playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of\u0027 Josephine\u0027 and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for \u0027Daphne\u0027.\n\nSome Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder\u0027s directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that\u0027s not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that\u0027s the very reason it\u0027s so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it\u0027s so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! \n\nBut you can\u0027t talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full\u0027s of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. \n\nSome Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",

The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki\u0027s work, but in Howl\u0027s Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.\n\nIt has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.\n\nHe achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.\n\nThe story is fantastic - I haven\u0027t read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki\u0027s work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.\n\nI can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!",

      "reviewBody": "Ran takes viewers to a place they would rather not explore on their own. In a world of cruelty, Kurasowa has shown how the moments within the horror can have beauty. Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do not have to be kings and princesses to identify with the father\u0027s desire for the well being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty and pain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran has done is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain to realize the beauty. Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve his madness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the small house of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister he forcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intense focus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is no dialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of the music. As with many of Kurasowa\u0027s films, despite their epic scope, it is the small paint strokes that make up the master\u0027s canvas.",

This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn\u0027t historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn\u0027t matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors.

It\u0027s multi-faceted and challenging and she definitely rose to the challenge. Celeste Holm is great, too. She\u0027s got a smaller part but does a great job with it. Celeste Holm is an actress who has incredible stature, even in the later years of her career, like when she was in that television show \"Promised Land.\" But Addison DeWitt - takes the cake. I can see why he won the Oscar. I don\u0027t want to say much about the story. The film is one that has to be taken in as a whole to be truly appreciated. Enjoy it - it\u0027s as tasty as honey!

      "reviewBody": "A Beautiful Mind\n\n Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience\u0027s heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin\u0027s kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he\u0027ll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.\n\nJohn Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He\u0027s socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.\n\nBut John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia\u0027s a tough disease, folks - it\u0027s still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.\n\nRussell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says \"Russell Crowe\", you\u0027ll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he\u0027s playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he\u0027s unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they\u0027re exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he\u0027s a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a \"hunk\" - their skills as actors aren\u0027t seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.\n\nAnd he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash\u0027s acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that\u0027s the essence of Crowe\u0027s performance. It\u0027s sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.\n\nHis supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she\u0027s the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn\u0027t an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.\n\nAnd yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don\u0027t know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I\u0027ll admit it, it got me right here. But it\u0027s okay; I did that old \u0027guy-crying-in-movie-theater\u0027 trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won\u0027t think you\u0027re a girly man.\n\nAt any rate, it\u0027s certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything\u0027s in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting.",

      "reviewBody": "I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I\u0027d be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.\n\nA special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose \u0027Captain Vidal\u0027 is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu\u0027s quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I\u0027ve seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting \u0027Pale Man\u0027 - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.\n\nBut the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete\u0027s hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one\u0027s death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.\n\nI loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don\u0027t give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro\u0027s greatest work to date.",

      "reviewBody": "From the brilliant \"Walt Disney of Japan\", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that\u0027s simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.\n\nSometimes you feel like you\u0027re not watching an animated children\u0027s movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There\u0027s no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.\n\nMiraculously, Totoro doesn\u0027t talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).\n\nI loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo\u0027s world.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.",

      "name": "The secret of Juan José",
      "reviewBody": "In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of \u0027cinema of the highest order\u0027. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we\u0027re going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country\u0027s past, a love story. And technically, if it\u0027s the highest order, there won\u0027t be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.\n\n\"El secreto de sus ojos\" tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn\u0027t completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. \"You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love\", Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.\n\nThere are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film\u0027s most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in \"El mismo amor, la misma lluvia\"; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in \"El mismo amor...\" it was a magazine staff, in \"Luna de Avellaneda\" the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year\u0027s best performances. \n\nThat\u0027s about everything we can expect. The fact is \"El secreto de sus ojos\" is a very good movie because there are things we don\u0027t see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn\u0027t been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It\u0027s quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with \"La señal\". Even though it\u0027s obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn\u0027t take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan\u0027s \"The Prestige\". It\u0027s quoting it somehow, at least.\n\nIt\u0027s very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We\u0027ve seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I\u0027m trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it\u0027s enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in \"El mismo amor...\"), but at the same time moving, simply because they\u0027re not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I\u0027ve mentioned.\n\nThe fact that Fernando Castets didn\u0027t write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It\u0027s the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director\u0027s previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces.",

      "reviewBody": "Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I\u0027m sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can\u0027t expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black\u0026white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It\u0027s not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo\u0027s paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. \n\nRaging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It\u0027s the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it\u0027s just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. \n\nIn Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn\u0027t like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn\u0027t care; \u0027cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. \n\nAt the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: \"A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!\". There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",

The mixture of comedy and violence was the thing that most amused me. The story itself isn\u0027t of the most original, but surely efficacious. The photography and the soundtrack were also brilliant and to finish, I saw Pulp Fiction, I loved it, but after seeing LS\u00262SM I was too busy thinking over and over how much I liked it for noticing a whatsoever similarity with PF. 10 out of 10 is a bit too much but 9/10 definitely isn\u0027t!

      "reviewBody": "Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he\u0027s contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.\n\nTelling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80\u0027s and 90\u0027s. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian\u0027s insight that felt like I was watching \"Intervention\" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone\u0027s Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That\u0027s a testament to Scorsese\u0027s outstanding direction and Terence Winter\u0027s masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They\u0027re like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren\u0027t aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.\n\nA lot of the credit of the film\u0027s overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I\u0027ve never seen him truly \"go for it\" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it\u0027s the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90\u0027s in What\u0027s Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he\u0027d been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It\u0027s a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio\u0027s crowning achievement.\n\nAs the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill\u0027s performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He\u0027s allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he\u0027s not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.\n\nLike any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan\u0027s outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan\u0027s second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she\u0027ll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she\u0027ll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she\u0027s required to be. She\u0027s the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson\u0027s character in Don Jon.\n\nI loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter\u0027s script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn\u0027t make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won\u0027t find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",

Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in Mexico \n\nBogart\u0027s Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with him \n\nTim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs\u0027s rage and greed \n\nHowever, it is the director\u0027s father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can\u0027t surprise him any more He\u0027s already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he\u0027s along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that\u0027s just a bonus \n\nIt is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" one of Warner Brothers\u0027 triumphs of the forties",

The language barriers and the confinement of the action masterfully resolved. Spencer Tracy is simply magnificent and, as per usual, we believe every word that comes out of his mouth. His judge is an American monument of unsentimental humanity. Twentynine year old Maimilian Schell won the Oscar as best actor and his performance survived the test of time with the vigor of his conviction. Montgomery Cliff makes his short minutes on the screen, one of those memorable moments that nobody that has ever seen it will be able to forget. The man and the character merging into one chilling, shattering truth. \"I am half the man I\u0027ve ever been\" Marlene Dietrich gives to her German aristocrat a legendary star quality. And Judy Garland, overweight and almost unrecognizable breaks your heart and gets her last Oscar nomination. My only troubles came with the stoic Burt Lancaster because I could never forget it was Burt Lancaster and with Richard Widmark\u0027s strident prosecutor.

All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for \"There Will Be Blood\", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood\u0027s chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show\u0027s in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother\u0027s struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.\n\nWhat begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. \"Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri\" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I\u0027ve never quite seen before. We\u0027re presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. \n\nThe movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character\u0027s motivations. It\u0027s obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it\u0027s constructed. \n\nOne of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they\u0027re in. That\u0027s not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. \n\nIf there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn\u0027t have changed anything about it. It\u0027s a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don\u0027t miss this one.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie came out in Turkey late 2005, without much advertising. It\u0027s a small family drama, set largely in western rural turkey in 1987. Within a couple of weeks, the film became a smash hit solely through word-of-mouth. Since then, it has received every national award and has become the third-biggest grossing film of the country\u0027s history by mid-March (it could go even higher, considering it\u0027s still playing in theaters after several months). It is indeed a good movie, but i doubt it\u0027ll reach the same kind of wide audiences outside the country. It\u0027s well-written, well-acted and well-shot; but some of the jokes, and especially the local accent that adds the movie a lot of its charm will be lost on international audiences i\u0027m afraid. Similarly, the film doesn\u0027t give much information about the political events that unfold in the background. I think one of the reasons the film did so well is that it reflects the atmosphere of the older Turkish films, from the industry\u0027s heyday in the sixties. Its mixture of comedy and tearjerker melodrama catches a very subtle balance. Granted, the melodrama bits are rather manipulative, but effective nonetheless. I heard that a tissue company did a campaign where they distributed tissues to the ingoing audiences, don\u0027t know if it\u0027s true though. My one (small) problem with the film is a few anachronistic details, but i guess they wouldn\u0027t even be noticed by someone who wasn\u0027t around then and there. If you come across this movie at a local festival or some other way (not very likely, but anyway), give it a shot. It\u0027s worth watching just to see the little kid in the leading role.",

It\u0027s the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie. It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it\u0027s a fine film.\n\nChaplin himself plays the \u0027Lone Prospector\u0027, and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama. There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors\u0027 rickety cabins, plus some other good material.\n\nThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940\u0027s, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel. (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren\u0027t used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin\u0027s narration how fond he must have been of \"The Gold Rush\", and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it. There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art.",

      "reviewBody": "Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.\n\nDial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it\u0027s weird in that even though she\u0027s cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he\u0027s trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie.",

      "reviewBody": "I was a fan of the \"V for Vendetta\" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he\u0027s always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore\u0027s music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.\n\nThe plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don\u0027t want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in \"Closer\". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it\u0027s too late.\n\nThe Wachowski Brothers\u0027 former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors\u0027 breakout hit \"The Matrix\". Unlike \"The Matrix\", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn\u0027t show off, and his trickery isn\u0027t self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli\u0027s score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.\n\nWith solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another \"Matrix\"-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in \"V\" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. \"V for Vendetta\" is a must-see.\n\n10/10",

There are several significant or interesting questions raised by the characters - from the imagery of the \"Seventh Seal\" in Revelation, to their simple but important concerns about eternity - but it is the way that the visuals play off of the ideas that make the movie so worthwhile.\n\nThe recreation of the medieval world is convincing and effective, with a lot of detail to set off a varied assortment of characters with different personalities and perspectives. The characters are not necessarily very deep, but most are interesting, and are worth caring about. The ways that they deal with their discouraging situation make you wonder what it would have been like to live in their world. It\u0027s also a movie that in some respects is even better to watch over again, after you already know what has happened and can then pick up even more of the detail and imagery.\n\nNo doubt the somber tone and slow pace will always keep it from being widely popular, and it\u0027s not perfect, but it\u0027s satisfying in a different way, and deserves its reputation as a classic.",

For Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco, Riley is directed by her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) in Headquarters Control Center inside Riley\u0027s mind to help her overcome everyday life. However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley\u0027s new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises. Although Joy, Riley\u0027s main and most fundamental emotion, tries to keep things optimistic, the emotions fight on how best to navigate Riley\u0027s new world.\n\nAfter watching \"Inside Out\" with my wife, we both agreed that \"Inside Out\" is the perfect Pixar Animation movie for any family on a night out. It was both imaginative and relatable for both children and adults. I never thought \"Inside Out\" would be this enjoyable, but I was able to experience every emotion of \"Joy\", \"Disgust\", \"Anger\", \"Fear\", and \"Sadness\" for each and every moment of this film. At the end of the night, I was pleasantly unsatisfied because I wanted to watch the movie again and again.

      "reviewBody": "Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there\u0027s nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole\u0027 cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.\n\nJosh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he\u0027s ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.\n\nWith its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you\u0027re left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it\u0027s a score that\u0027s frightening and precise.\n\n-Eric Statzer",

The film doesn\u0027t go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won\u0027t get needlessly scared.\n\nThe film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film.

      "reviewBody": "An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I\u0027ve met, you\u0027ve met and we\u0027ve all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved in\n\nare most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of \"Human Traffic\" and the somber tone of \"My name is Joe\" and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of \"Perfect day\" and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise. Superb.",

      "reviewBody": "If one was to turn on David Lynch\u0027s The Elephant Man midway through, without knowing what it was, one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one\u0027s sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), \u0027The Elephant Man,\u0027 would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he\u0027s there. There he is. And it\u0027s no big deal. \n\nThis is the beauty of Lynch\u0027s direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, \u0027is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?\u0027\n\nLynch certainly doesn\u0027t let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin\u0027s Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.\n\nTechnically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930\u0027s. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick\u0027s shoes. It is unsettling.\n\nBut Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we\u0027ve already, what he\u0027s already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.\n\nThe Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can\u0027t help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. It asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside, he\u0027s okay.",

      "reviewBody": "I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn\u0027t seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe\u0027s old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.\n\nThe acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis\u0027 depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment\u0027s loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I\u0027ve ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.\n\nThe plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.",

      "reviewBody": "This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.\n\nSet on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?\n\nThe gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that\u0027s just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it\u0027s wrath is huge and the results are horrific.\n\nThis is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don\u0027t miss it.",

What film doesn\u0027t have small flaws, they pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn\u0027t let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from the child protagonist. \n\n**Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of a sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view this film.",

His love scenes with Scarlett give the picture a vibrancy that is one of its great attractions... The film begins with their first stormy meeting in the library at Twelve Oaks and intensifies at the Atlanta bazaar, when he shocks the confederacy by bidding $l00 \"in gold,\" to dance with the newly widowed Mrs. Hamilton who cares for nothing but herself\n\nHattie McDaniel gives a rich characterization as Mammy, Scarlett\u0027s shrewd black servant who was never fooled by Scarlett\u0027s airs and tears...\n\nWith a memorable music score by Max Steiner, the film was an instant classic, winner of eight Academy Awards...",

      "reviewBody": "I don\u0027t know why I loved this movie so much. Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree. Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors. It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar. Whatever it was, it made me write this review.\n\nAllan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour. They agree and are taken to an island where \"Jurassic Park\" logos are everywhere. The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into. The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience. What the two of them don\u0027t know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....\n\nDirected by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature. Usually you get second-rate actors who can\u0027t act, getting terrified by monsters that don\u0027t really exist. Jurassic Park was the opposite. It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever. Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.\n\nFrom beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs. Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT. There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances. The whole family should watch this movie. Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs. I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad. The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3). A climax-less bad film, that was. But this....this was magic. And yes, it was a masterpiece.\n\nThe magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too. I had a \"Jurassic Park\" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic. You will feel the magic too once you see it. I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you. Even if you don\u0027t like creature-features, this movie will entertain you. Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the \"life will find a way\" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.\n\nAbsolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.\n\n10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)",

      "reviewBody": "This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you\u0027ve just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It\u0027s told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.\n\nNow, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says \"Ah-Ha!\". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he\u0027s sworn to kill.\n\nBlade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director\u0027s Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut\u0027s much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.\n\nFinally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don\u0027t give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated \"Lord of the Rings\" sheen common in today\u0027s effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn\u0027t rely on special effects. This is an important distinction to make in today\u0027s Hollywood.\n\n\"Touch of Evil\" really wasn\u0027t the last of the Great Film Noirs!",

      "reviewBody": "Without belittling `Kwai,\u0027 it does seem, looking backwards at David Lean\u0027s career, to be a dress rehearsal for the more operatic, tightly controlled (and better written) `Lawrence of Arabia.\u0027 Alec Guiness\u0027s passionate, detailed performance as Colonel Nicholson, above all other factors, makes Kwai a still watchable and important experience. The screenplay, however, divides unevenly between those who must build the Bridge and those who must destroy it. Ebert, in his Great Movies article, correctly identifies William Holden\u0027s character in Kwai as undergoing an implausible transition from escaped POW to martini-guzzling playboy to selfless war hero. Verbatim: `Holden\u0027s character, up until the time their guerrilla mission begins, seems fabricated; he\u0027s unconvincing playing a shirker, and his heroism at the end seems more plausible.\u0027 That, I believe, is also Kwai\u0027s greatest weakness. Holden\u0027s relationship with Jack Hawkins (playing a parallel role to his General Allenby in Lawrence) seems pallid next to the mighty Guiness/Hayakawa standoff  in fact, it seems to be in another movie altogether. Also, Malcolm Arnold\u0027s score, which I loved when I was a kid, seems now jarringly inappropriate from start to finish. I am too much influenced, I suppose, by the rock and roll jungle menace of Coppola\u0027s `Apocalypse Now.\u0027 Lastly, it is many decades past 1957. Images of whistling soldiers, marching proudly after months of captivity, then putting on an `entertainment\u0027 more expected in the world of Rodgers and Hammerstein, may ring very false to today\u0027s viewer. But keep your eyes fastened tight to Alec Guiness. Kwai is the Everest of his career, and very few actors climb that high.",

The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.\n\nSparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman\u0027s regulars  Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of \"Wild Strawberries\" which also include Bergman\u0027s writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It\u0027s a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.\n\n I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That\u0027s usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I\u0027m allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they\u0027re not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that\u0027s important for a good comedy. And it\u0027s hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She\u0027s an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she\u0027s doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. \n\nMovies like this aren\u0027t just being made for children exclusive... They\u0027re good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you\u0027re 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",

      "reviewBody": "Even today in Vienna, one can take the \"Third Man Tour\" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn\u0027t go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double. Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.\n\nWestern novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry\u0027s body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.\n\nHe then meets Harry\u0027s girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it\u0027s better that he\u0027s dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.\n\nOne of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there\u0027s some brilliant dialogue, particularly the \"cuckoo clock\" speech made by Orson Welles.\n\nThe cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.\n\nOne feels Lime\u0027s presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.\n\nThough none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.\n\nThere was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero. \n\nHe\u0027s no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched \"On the Waterfront\" last night, and I have seen it many times. This movie is a perfect capsule for any viewer. The actors are superb in their roles, the dialogue is raw and powerful, the staging is tight and reflects the claustrophobic nature of the characters\u0027 lives in this part of Hoboken. You have the feeling that they never leave this area of maybe a few blocks, because they feel trapped by their circumstances, poverty, grueling work, and the corruption that\u0027s endemic in this place and system.\n\nMarlon Brando is Terry, a failed prize fighter with deep regrets and loneliness, who is a low-level thug in this corrupt system dominated by the bombastic, cruel union boss, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb in an electrifying performance). He rules the waterfront with brutality and terror. To make Terry feel even more trapped is the fact that his only living relative, his brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), is Friendly\u0027s right-hand man. Terry has no great ambitions in life, and seems resigned to this bleak path until fate, and two shining lights, appear in his life: Edie (Eva Marie Saint), a decent, loving, determined and angelic blonde woman, and Father Barry (Karl Malden), the local priest who can throw a punch, drink a beer and stand up to the mob with the strength of his faith behind him. \n\nTerry and Edie embark on a seemingly doomed romance that both actors play so beautifully. You can feel their yearning, their awkwardness, their passion for each other and their deep connection -- all without the explicit nudity and fake grunting used in contemporary movies. When they embrace, you feel their desperation and desire for each other in a profound way.\n\n\"On the Waterfront\" is certainly director Elia Kazan\u0027s great masterpiece. The performances are all outstanding, and Brando is just a marvel of tortured pain and passion and agony and courage. One particular thing I love about \"On the Waterfront\" is the scenery. Every set or outdoor shot conveys the grim, cold nature of the characters\u0027 lives. There is no movie glamour and little comfort here. Only a hot cup of coffee made on a plug-in heating plate in a \"cold-water flat,\" or a beer and a shot hastily consumed in a waterfront saloon are pleasures to these characters. Their clothes are patched. Edie\u0027s hair isn\u0027t \"styled,\" and she wears no makeup. Terry\u0027s face is a bit scarred. Malden\u0027s nose is...as we all know. The gritty setting feels real. If you\u0027ve never seen this movie for any reason, do not delay!",

      "reviewBody": "Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It\u0027s down to earth and believable.\n\nJerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don\u0027t exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.\n\nThe Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It\u0027s a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn\u0027t try to be anything it isn\u0027t. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don\u0027t even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they\u0027re reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.\n\nThe actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.\n\nThe cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.\n\nThe score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It\u0027s moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It\u0027s used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.\n\nFargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it\u0027s well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",

I expected to see a lot of milking of seventies cinema, television and music and I think Tarantino milked the whole decade dry, or what was left of it after his earlier movies, in this first part of Kill Bill. The main reason I want to see part two is to see what could possibly be left to milk from the seventies to fill up the second part of the movie. As a fan of seventies cinema, television and music I feel irritated by the use of the Green Hornet theme music and other such milking, it feels cheap and too easy to me. But these irritations aside I loved Uma Thurman in this movie and it\u0027s great to see her carry a lead and hack away like she means it. Hack away FOR A WHILE, that is, not for a whole hour. Halfway through the big lengthy kung fu massacre I was really starting to look at my watch and thinking this is ridiculous by any standard, comedy, horror, drama or whatever. Can we just kill Bill and get it over with?",

Jim Carrey plays an excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be entertained by. The film\u0027s surrealistic nature is frightening when the viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today\u0027s society, and it offers a great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as an aquarium. Some things to note and ponder: The way the real-life viewers ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living? Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the \"real world\" in the credits, but in \"Christof\u0027s World.\" His high-profile media-driven life is no different from Truman\u0027s!",

      "reviewBody": "If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood\u0027s Gran Torino is the dark horse. This rousing crowd-pleaser is sure to surprise many, through its copious sour humour and pure badassery, while managing to still be an affecting and sombre dramatic entry in Eastwood\u0027s long-enduring and wildly successful career in front of and behind the camera.\n\nYou know that a movie has something going for it when it can a) pack in so many one-liners you can\u0027t bring yourself to remember them after the show from oversaturation of the brain, b) be unboundedly racist yet still never seen exploitative or condescending and c) make a pure, grit- and-nails, grimacing anti-hero, one man army out of a seventy-eight year old man. What is likely to surprise the most number of viewers is how funny this movie really is. Eastwood\u0027s direction and line delivery as a diamond-hard antisocial veteran is bang-on, but never makes the film into a farce or embarrassment. This is due in part to the handling of the more touching dramatic moments which anchors the film in reality and reminds us of what is at play, so to speak.\n\nFollowing the death of his wife, Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) has nothing left but his dog to truly be with. His two sons and their families drift in and out, but Walt\u0027s less then cheerful demeanour and their impartiality keeps them in different worlds and in different times. Walt is peppered by visits from Father Janovich (Christopher Carley) of the local church at the request of his late wife to \u0027keep an eye on him\u0027, but has little place for religion on his heavy conscience; about as much time as he has for his new Hmong neighbours that move in next door. That is until the family\u0027s youngest son Thao (Bee Vang) begins to be harassed by a local gang who persuade him to steal Walt\u0027s prized Gran Torino as initiation. Saving Thao in an ensuing altercation, Walt sweeps the fatherless teen away from the pressures of the criminal life and puts him to work at the request of his mother. Thao and his sister Sue (Ahney Her) befriend Walt in a way, and for a reason none can truly explain.\n\nAll of the Hmong actors in Gran Torino are pure novices who have never acted before and this is readily apparent. While a weak link, the film as a whole is so satisfying it is really a moot point as it serves as no thorough determent. The arc of Walt is simple and easy to predict, but then anything but would not work. Many scenes with the cultural clashes are funny and touching as with an unspoken dynamic with the elderly grandmother of the Lor family next door. A number of exchanges between the few remaining people in Walt\u0027s life who he still respects such as his barber and a construction worker who gets Thao a job, are nothing short of comic genius and piece the Walt character into a true three- dimensional individual.\n\nWith a great song by Jamie Cullum to conclude the film (which stands as a horrendous Oscar snub, equalled only by the additional snub of the Bruce Springsteen Song from The Wrestler), Gran Torino is a pure gem; a film that both draws unexpected laughs, soft smiles and tears from an audience that is happy to oblige, as well as salute a screen legend in another iconic role that proves even at an old age a dark horse can still kick you in the face.",

It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.\n\nHowever who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.\n\nOzu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it.\n\nImpressing also to see how close the everyday life of Japan in the mid 50s is to the western way of life.",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve seen this movie in the cinema ten years ago when I was younger and now, after seeing it again, I\u0027m surprised that I still get the same emotions from it. In my review, I\u0027ll try to stay away of spoilers but I\u0027ll also give you a good treatment of the plot as well (just the big-picture).\n\nMovie starts as Baran, an old eskiya (a honorable bandit) is getting out of prison after 35 years of jail to find his village and his home under the waters of Firat river. He then learns that his confinement was due to an old comrade\u0027s betrayal, and that his comrade took away and married his lover, Keje. Baran comes to the biggest city of Turkey, Istanbul to seek his old comrade and maybe to take revenge...\n\nDue to an unlikely coincidence, he meets Cumali, a young man that has no family and is living in Istanbul, earning his life with criminal acts. Baran the Eskiya is not familiar with the city-life but Cumali is willing to help him because of his debt.\n\nBaran the eskiya has a deep character, despite his criminal past, he looks like a naive person in the metropolitan city of Istanbul. Despite that he is an uneducated person, he may be the most honorable and wise person in this big city. Sener Sen (Baran) and Ugur Yucel (Cumali) each gives spectacular acting performance and their talents combined with an intelligent script breathe life into this \"Eskiya\" myth. Baran is the last of the Eskiyas !\n\nThe movie has a slow start but towards the ending, the mood gets stronger. The movie reaches it\u0027s climax at the dramatic scenes to the finish. This is a story about honor and the power of love. This is a story about two strangers that are becoming tied emotionally, like the father and the son. A classic Turkish Action/Drama movie for all to see ! \n\nPS. also check out another Turkish movie \"Kabadayi\" by the same director/writer (Yavuz Turgul) and the same actor (Sener Sen).",

The script never loosens its grip on the nerves. The potential challenges of losing the heart of a short film while making it into a feature is always present but the makers of Andhadhun really succeeded in laying the foundation for future talents. Coming back to the film, it is chaotic, hilarious n very ntertaining. It is well paced and has funny situations as well as a black sense of humor. Watch out for that shady hospital scene man. The movie is well cast, with amusing performances by Ayushman n Tabu. The director did a superb job. Raghavan was definitely having a little fun after the dark thriller Badlapur.",

      "reviewBody": "The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter). I am very fond of their work. Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes. Their best stories evolve from kidnapping schemes in films like \"Raising Arizona \" and \"Fargo\", one of my very favorites. I thought that film was fervently free. I was so ever wrong. It\u0027s as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please. \"The Big Lebowski\" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter. The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug. This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins. We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates. This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and \u0027Nam veterans. This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it\u0027s so grandiosely different. Yet who couldn\u0027t chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball\u0027s finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists\u0027 feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though! One can not keep a straight face whilst watching.",

I can\u0027t find a bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- way through, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, a must-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you.

      "reviewBody": "Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film. Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it. Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in. Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it. This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best. Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.\n\nDaniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn\u0027t want to grow up. He has had so many troubles at home his father\n\nGiuseppe played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.\n\nFrom there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other\u0027s feeling and face up to where they stand in the world. Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad. What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it\u0027s more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.\n\nOne film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.",

      "reviewBody": "Two movies for the price of one. \n\nThat\u0027s a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard \"did he or didn\u0027t he\" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you\u0027re watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you\u0027ve ever seen. \n\nDespite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck\u0027s Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike\u0027s Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.\n\nDavid Fincher\u0027s direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn\u0027t need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.\n\nGone Girl is a movie unlike any that I\u0027ve ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",

Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don\u0027t see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss\u0027s act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it\u0027s place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",

As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers.

His latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, which opened the Berlin Film Festival, continues that trend. It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author \u0026 F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson \u0026 countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences. The production design and music are outstanding and even the end credits are imaginatively done (and received another ovation from the audience).",

But here, that is not the case. James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role. That\u0027s saying a lot given his impressive body of work. This is also Frank Capra\u0027s signature film along with Mr. Deeds. The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but, and I know this is a cliché, the world could use more people with his values. The supporting cast is also spot on. Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr. Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith. Strongly recommended, 9/10.",

The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier, but as a train engineer. However, his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform. After the war has started, the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keaton\u0027s train, and so begins the greatest (and funniest) chase ever filmed. For the next 75 minutes, the viewer is in Keaton\u0027s world. His gags, routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmed.\n\n-Matt, age 16",

      "reviewBody": "Four-fifths of the way into my second viewing of Persona within a week, I placed my hands on my head and exclaimed, \"I got it!\"\n\nOut of all the Ingmar Bergman films I\u0027ve seen, Persona is easily the most difficult. Others have difficult subject matters or portray difficult situations with clarity, but Persona is the first where I thought I understood what was happening both literally and thematically but I simply could not connect with it. What convinced me to give it a second try so soon after my first foray into it on this Bergman odyssey (I had seen it once before in college) was the film\u0027s reputation as a masterpiece and one of Bergman\u0027s best. If the movie didn\u0027t have that reputation, I would have pumped out a 3-star review and called it quits. Instead, I insisted on a second viewing, which I am very glad that I did. Because, you know, I got it.\n\nIn between my first and second viewings, I read a bit about Persona. I read the essay included with the Criterion Collection box set and I read Roger Ebert\u0027s Great Movie review. Neither did the work of convincing me on their own that what I had watched was a masterpiece, but Ebert\u0027s in particular gave me advice on how to watch.\n\nThe thing about Persona is that it is unbelievably dense. Every word, image, and cut betrays some meaning. That density invites a host of different, often conflicting, interpretations which is a lot to process when the audience isn\u0027t quite sure what they\u0027re even looking at to begin with.\n\nAlright, enough of that, what\u0027s the story?\n\nAn actress, Elisabet Vogler, stopped speaking in the middle of a performance of Electra and has been admitted to a hospital. A young nurse, Sister Alma, has been assigned to Elisabet, but Alma has doubts about her ability in the face of what she sees to be an obviously difficult task. The two end up sent to a remote house on the Swedish coast where they spend some time together. Alma continues to speak almost endlessly to the point that she confesses to an infidelity against her fiancé in rather explicit detail. The two women steadily look more and more alike and Alma seems to change. There\u0027s a scene where Elisabet enters Alma\u0027s room at night and the two seem to merge. There\u0027s another where Elisabet\u0027s husband arrives and confuses Alma for Elisabet to the point that they (probably) make love. It all comes to a head in a scene that actually plays twice in a row. Alma finds Elisabet with a torn image of the actress\u0027s son, and Alma cuts deeply into Elisabet\u0027s past and identifying exactly how Elisabet feels about her son (all while Elisabet had never said a word about it).\n\nMy \"I got it!\" moment came in that scene.\n\nBergman\u0027s always been about people more than anything else. His topic and the focus of his lens is the human face. He wasn\u0027t going to abandon that the second he decided to use an experimental montage to open his film. I referenced something that Roger Ebert wrote that helped open up the movie for me, and it was this (paraphrased): Read the movie literally. So, I watched the movie as literally as possible. I shoved aside the idea that the two women might actually be one (something that may still be possible) or everything about dreams (I take those scenes as literally happening), and I saw the story of two women finding a way to connect.\n\nBoth try to connect with the other for different reasons. Alma wants to connect with Elisabet in order to discover how to convince the patient to speak again. Elisabet wants to connect with Alma as research for a part. Neither can understand the other at first. They look different, dress differently, and (even considering Elisabet\u0027s silence) they interact with the world differently. Quickly, once they reach the coast, they begin to dress alike. First it\u0027s a pair of hats that are of similar styles (Alma\u0027s extends down implying a more limited view while Elisabet\u0027s brim is flat implying that she\u0027s looking further out), then their clothes begin to resemble each other. There\u0027s one point where Alma leans over with Elisabet in the background, and it\u0027s impossible to discern where the shirt of one begins and the other ends.\n\nWhen we finally get to the scene where Alma reveals Elisabet\u0027s core issue, it suddenly became obvious. We are watching two women trying to understand each other at the deepest levels, and the only way to make that happen is to inhabit the other person completely. There\u0027s the core of the film. There\u0027s the emotional center that drives the stylistic and visual nuances throughout the film (in particular the moment the two women\u0027s faces are superimposed over each other). The framing device is part of that as well. The framing device is filled with images of early cinema and finally a boy trying to touch a large face behind a glass. This implies that there will always be a barrier between people on the two sides of a screen, meaning that we, the audience, can only ever get so close to the people we are watching.\n\nMy breakthrough on the film would actually work quite well with the idea that there is only one woman and that the whole movie is actually just a split-second of time where Elisabet was frozen in the middle of a performance. I haven\u0027t thought through the idea, though. Another viewing could bring that more to the forefront.\n\nAnd that\u0027s the other key to Persona\u0027s power. It\u0027s so rich that it allows for this kind of exploration across multiple viewings. I remember reading a comment from someone on a message board about how a movie that didn\u0027t grab him on a first viewing was unworthy of a second. I\u0027m so glad I don\u0027t subscribe to that line of thinking. If I did, I would have seen Persona once in college, not understood it, and never bothered to revisit it at all, much less twice in one week more than a decade later.",

      "reviewBody": "HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one \"action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects\" after another. But wait...\n\nHTTYD stands apart from these other attempts for a number of reasons. First, the 3D (Odeon digital in this screening) is moving more toward the subtle with fewer \"gratuitous\" 3D moments than in movies like Bolt and Coraline. As 3D becomes a staple of high street cinema, directors seem to be finding 3D to be more about adding depth rather than a brief focal-point. That\u0027s not to say that there isn\u0027t effective use of the 3D wow-factor here; it\u0027s just not all the film has to hold attention.\n\nSecond, a cast of voice talent that does not demand too much consideration of the man/woman behind the microphone is refreshing. Baruchel is not over-playing the sugar or the heroics and, as much as an animated character can be, he is believable and as three-dimensional as the visuals. Butler is not greatly stretched here but manages to stay just the right side of a Mike Myers impression so as not to annoy. How many kids will now think the Vikings were a fearsome race of Americans and Scots? Oh, well! \n\nThird, the plot and dialogue. You may not know the plot and I won\u0027t spoil it now. It is straightforward stuff but the pace keeps it interesting for kids and the grown-ups. Younger children may be upset at times and I heard a sob or two at the emotional moments. Nothing too heavy here though, it\u0027s just a well-written script with as many actual laughs as I have seen in a kids\u0027 film.\n\nThis is one of the best films so far in this prolific genre and it has been made with passion rather than thrown together to cash-in on the thirst for these films, right now. I would urge all ages to see this film in 3D as the textures are extraordinary and you can\u0027t help but be charmed by it all.",

The story also relies heavily on dialogue. It has some parallels to Lost in Translation, although Before Sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.\n\nThe script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. The actors play absolutely brilliantly. Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.\n\nThe dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. It does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. Sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! Only very, very rarely is \"love\" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic. Every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. She still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.\n\nThis is simply a gem of a movie that you can\u0027t miss. One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s!",

Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.\n\nThe first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster\u0027s father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son\u0027s films.\n\nThere\u0027s a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.\n\nIt is in Junior\u0027s other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.\n\nSherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.\n\nJustly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton\u0027s cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today.",

Aaron Guzikowski\u0027s script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year\u0027s Oscars.",

      "name": "12 Years A Slave earns the right to be called one of the best films of the year.",
      "reviewBody": "If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it\u0027s Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity\u0027s primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I\u0027m so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year\u0027s Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It\u0027s a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.\n\nNaturally, scenes were cut (whether in the editing room or pre-production I don\u0027t know) and that\u0027s a blessing and a curse. Now in the film, we rush to Solomon Northup\u0027s capture, opening with scenes we shall revisit later on. I understand the decision to enter the world as quickly as possible, but I do feel it hurts its first act. As much as I jump for joy every time Scoot McNairy hides himself in a film, the transition from ordinary life to becoming kidnapped feels jarring and contrived. Who is Solomon Northup as a free man? What does he want? Maybe we don\u0027t know because there is no source for the matter. Maybe McQueen isn\u0027t interested in telling that story. At the very least, we definitely know that Solomon is a compelling character during his capture. Chiwetel Ejiofor is an actor I\u0027ve always liked but he\u0027s never made an impression until now. His passion and commitment to his portrayal of Solomon is utterly captivating. While he can slink into the background of some scenes where he is not the focus, when it\u0027s time to shine he bursts a fuse.\n\nUnfortunately during this cluttered first act, it concerns itself too much with subplots that we know will not succeed. While they accomplish establishing the stakes at hand and rule out the \u0027why doesn\u0027t Solomon just\u0027 there\u0027s just too many abridged tales. Perhaps this is distracting just because I know the full stories from the script, but they should\u0027ve went all or nothing with them. It results in editing that frustratingly refuses to let us into Solomon\u0027s headspace. We\u0027re along for the ride, but too frequently not Solomon\u0027s ride. During then we only get rare and rewarding glimpses into how he feels and his perspective on his past life stolen from him. Fortunately the film vastly improves once Solomon is free from the deliciously cruel Paul Giamatti to the spiteful live-wire Paul Dano. As the film focuses on his one-on-one conflicts and moral dilemmas, the film reaches intimate and truly challenging moments which is where the film\u0027s power lies. Fruitless subplots are dropped in favour of heartbreaking ones as we\u0027re introduced to the pitiful Patsey on the pathetic Edwin Epps\u0027 plantation.\n\nMichael Fassbender and Steve McQueen have been one of the most enthralling director/actor combination in recent years. They always bring out the best in each other. Here, it feels like they\u0027ve reached their finest work yet, but still feels like their collaboration has just began. Fassbender\u0027s Edwin Epps is the film\u0027s most fascinating and complex character, a man who sincerely refuses to believe he is evil. He demonstrates the thesis of the film in that the authoritative caucasians didn\u0027t believe they were doing anything wrong. Many people have laid claim that he is pure evil, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the point, he belongs in a misguided world where he thinks his lust and affection is apt praise for Patsey\u0027s talent. While I may not have sympathy for him, he is a tortured soul, a regrettable and irreversible tragedy of mankind and this is thanks to Fassbender\u0027s incredible performance. His victim Patsey, played by talented newcomer Lupita Nyong\u0027o, is an utter revelation. She may not have a fully developed character but in at least two powerful scenes, she makes the best out of what she can for a character that warrants the tears you will inevitably shed.\n\nOne of the most consistent aspects of McQueen\u0027s films is the magnificent taste in cinematography and production design. Presumably from his art background, he\u0027s great at immersing you into his bleak visual worlds. Working with Sean Bobbit again, the cinematography is reliably enchanting. In true McQueen style, if a character must endure patiently, in this case Solomon hanging from a noose on the tips of his toes, we must endure with them. No shot this year, not even in the extraordinary Gravity, has been as stunning and unforgettable as the infamous long take of Patsey\u0027s lashes. It\u0027s a filmmaking masterclass in just a few short minutes. Despite the shaky first half hour, it\u0027s all redeemed in its harrowing final 15 minutes. It\u0027s the greatest sequence I\u0027ve seen in a long time and I\u0027ve never had a scene make me a blubbering mess quite like it. Yes, the jump to his kidnapping feels abrupt and there\u0027s no sense of relief to his inevitable freedom, but this is all calculated to mirror the struggle of his experience and we\u0027ve felt every beat. 12 Years A Slave is a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit with its theme of injustice applicable to any point in history that earns the right to be one of the best of the year. After a string of lightweight Best Picture choices from the Academy, this will be a refreshing choice. \n\n9/10",

      "name": "Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it",
      "reviewBody": "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce\u0027s novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it\u0027s transfer to the big screen. I was not disappointed.\n\nCool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that. It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into. When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is \"Small Town, not much to do in the evening\", which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid. Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds \"just settlin some old scores\". It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property. As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private. Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body\u0027s rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong. At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, \"calling it your job don\u0027t make it right, Boss.\" In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, \"A man\u0027s got to go his own way\" or as he also puts it, \"I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can\u0027t seem to find no elbow room\". \n\nAs Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates. Some of them wear chains, some of them do not. It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes. We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform. You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line. As the Captain reiterates, \"for your own good, you\u0027ll learn the rules\" A point driven home often.\n\nWhat we discover about their crimes is minuscule. One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us. It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don\u0027t feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce\u0027s story, and Luke as the focal point.\n\n Because of his individuality, it doesn\u0027t take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates. It is not a role he chooses, or even wants. It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others. He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn\u0027t have to deal with it. He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.\n\nAnother principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy). It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten. Dragline\u0027s admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process. He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm. I can\u0027t remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.\n\nCool Hand Luke is not without it\u0027s humorous moments especially in the early going. It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages. Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke\u0027s dilemma.\n\nIn translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen. Lalo Shifrin\u0027s memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang. Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here. \n\nAs Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career. It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman\u0027s role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character. As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I\u0027m at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who\u0027s Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.\n\nCool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word. It is a film that will long be remembered.\n\nMy grade: A+",

      "reviewBody": "George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. \u0027Mad Max: Fury Road\u0027 is ridiculous in all the right ways.\n\nFor those who have seen the original films and loved them, you\u0027ll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young \u0027\"wives\" escape from the film\u0027s antagonist.\n\nLeading up to the film\u0027s release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron\u0027s character. Is the story something we haven\u0027t seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it\u0027s nice to see a solid narrative.\n\nNow, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character\u0027s make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It\u0027s motivated. And it\u0027s glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.\n\n\u0027Mad Max: Fury Road\u0027 has set a new standard for action films. It\u0027s arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It\u0027s that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80\u0027s action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It\u0027s the best time I\u0027ve had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn\u0027t help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",

      "name": "A brilliant thriller. One of the most suspenseful and exciting movies ever made!",
      "reviewBody": "Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, \u0027Les Diaboliques\u0027 and \u0027The Wages Of Fear\u0027, both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension. Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. \u0027The Wages Of Fear\u0027 could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that\u0027s what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make \u0027Wages Of Fear\u0027 a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don\u0027t come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece.",

I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you\u0027re a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there\u0027s that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.\n\nStand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They\u0027ve obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid\u0027s body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it\u0027s a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it\u0027s the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.\n\nThese are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can\u0027t get any love or respect from his father and it\u0027s obvious that he gets it from his friends. That\u0027s what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy\u0027s best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he\u0027s the kid who you knew in school and just knew he\u0027d turn out bad, but there\u0027s a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who\u0027s been disappointed so many times by an adult.\n\nTeddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there\u0027s Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other\u0027s appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.\n\nThe acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That\u0027s what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "I\u0027ve never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won\u0027t speak to story here as it\u0027s covered in the other comments.\n\nThis is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.\n\nThe feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn\u0027t feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I\u0027m not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can\u0027t say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it\u0027s making me sound like a hippie, for heaven\u0027s sake. This for me was Penn\u0027s best work since Indian Runner.\n\nWhat it reminded me of...\n\n\n* Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold \u0026 Maude...) - even a bit of Ken Loach\n\n\n\n* Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn\u0027t Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider\n\n\n... but when I list those it\u0027s not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it\u0027s again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was \"too long\" but I don\u0027t agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.\n\nHal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder\u0027s music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.",

      "reviewBody": "In fact it\u0027s one of Kubrick\u0027s most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of \"Dr. Strangelove\" (and it\u0027s unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s). English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into \"the trap of the picturesque\", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world. Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don\u0027t have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.\n\nTHIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen. Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it\u0027s cut altogether - you won\u0027t catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in. The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it\u0027s about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don\u0027t. (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.) And as always, Kubrick\u0027s musical sense is unerring. My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles. I was more or less right. But then I noticed Schubert\u0027s name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I\u0027d been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.\n\nIt\u0027s a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this. Look at the ones he\u0027s responsible for: \"Spartacus\" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) \"2001\" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and \"Barry Lyndon\". The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",

Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through \"Pale Rider\" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn\u0027t lie to them, doesn\u0027t kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even \"Boys don\u0027t Cry\" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That\u0027s a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",

      "name": "A Realistic Vietnam film Oliver\u0027s Stone\u0027s masterpiece",
      "reviewBody": "Platoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver Stone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time. It is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver Stone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone\u0027s Vietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of the story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced after his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a screenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his experiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were portrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human been than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death. \n\nThose of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what\u0027s left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning in this life. \n\nIn Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier who, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do battle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear, physical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two commanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against the enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos and hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his feelings to man\u0027s highest value... life.\n\nChris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to see in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge. They both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn\u0027t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the \"enemy\" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at all it\u0027s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is at one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for the souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in doubt.\n\nThe platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is discovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man\u0027s wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man\u0027s young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. \n\nElias doesn\u0027t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.\n\nPlatoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a film that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a damn to watch. There isn\u0027t any War film today that was filmed as really human drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very essence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the history.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and storytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its frighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam War as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls of men.\n\nThe best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam from the 80\u0027s, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death to see. I also don\u0027t watch this film for an action ; I actually see it for the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is life: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the characters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad soldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.\n\nThe battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the final battle. 10/10",

Now he is manning an oar in a ship\u0027s galley and his family is imprisoned. Years pass and now Heston is after the former childhood friend (Stephen Boyd), a Roman, that turned against him. The 17 minutes of footage for the chariot race is some of the best during the history of the cinema.

      "reviewBody": "The true story of the rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda and the 1976 Formula One season is one of those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction. Fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories, Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, have taken this project on, giving us a movie that is about a clash of ideals and personalities as well as about the drive of motor sports.\n\nJames Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are racing drivers with different approaches and philosophies whose rivalry starts in Formula Three racing. Hunt is a good looking playboy who enjoys drinking, partying and sex and has charisma to boot. Lauda is a serious minded, extremely determined, technically astute and is able to get the most out of a car, but is a cold, distant man who drives people away. Soon the men\u0027s rivalry see them battling it out in Formula One leading to the 1976 season where back-stabbing, danger and disaster affects the sport.\n\nAs a sports movie Rush is a very well made and entertaining film that focuses on its characters ideals and differences. Hemsworth and Brühl are in top form as they play these very different men. Lauda is a self- determined man who is willing to risk everything to get into F1, but easily rubs people the wrong way, whilst Hunt had a greater support network, media friendly but is a loose cannon. Both end up becoming each other\u0027s hubris as they take bigger risks in a sport that already dangerous.\n\nAs well as the focus of their profession, Rush looks at the personal lifestyles of the two drivers, particularly Hunt\u0027s as he womanizes as Lauda settles down with a woman. Hunt is a thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst Lauda is aware of the risks of his profession, but does not want to add to them.\n\nTo anyone who knows about Niki Lauda is he suffers a tragedy and the easy route would have been to make Rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity. Fortunately, Howard and Morgan made something more interesting by showing both men to be faulted, that Lauda is not a man who is easy to like, making personal digs against and being a very sore loser.\n\nAt a running of two hours, three minutes, Rush moves along at a very brisk pace. The first 40 to 45 minutes focuses on a six year period as the rivalry builds up. Many story elements are dealt with quickly. A great example of this is when Hunt meets model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde, who does an impressive English accent) in the team garages and the next scene is them getting married. Rush is a movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes. It does seem like a longer cut may exist.\n\nEven though the film is called Rush, Howard and Morgan build up to the racing segments. We get a F3 race near the beginning and then we have a long wait the F1 races. Howard and Morgan focus on three main races in the 1976 season, Nürburgring, Germany, Monza, Italy and Fuji, Japan. Howard shows his technical acumen with the racing sequences, as we get up close to the action on screen with camera being place many on the parts of the cars, in the driving seat and even in the engine and in the air gun during a tyre change. There are intense, exciting sequences as Howard uses stylistic flashes and slo-mo as we see how dangerous races were in the 70s. Morgan also uses a similar montage trick he used in The Damned United to quickly build a picture of the \u002776 season with Howard using title cards to the sequence a bit of flash.\n\nThe story about James Hunt or Niki Lauda could have made for a compelling movie on their own terms, but Howard and Morgan give us two films in one. Rush is a very well-made, engaging and compelling sports flick that is character driven and is about the build-up as well as the racing.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",

      "reviewBody": "I admit I was taken aback with this one. I hadn\u0027t planned on watching as Wolverine films tend to be a bore to me. Not long into it, I was sure I had missed a previous film, one that would explain for example how Xavier ended up broken and hidden away, how Wolverine has washed up as an alcoholic limo driver.\n\nBut no this is it apparently, and this is the thing.\n\nWe can be lowered late at night in the middle of a world that has long now been spun in motion. We can discover as we go. We can catch glimpses of a larger world as we move through it. We don\u0027t need to be racing to save the world, making it out of this room alive is enough, wondering and having no idea where to turn to next are fine.\n\nNone of it is novel, in fact all of them mainstays of 80s film, from Bladerunner to Terminator. But after a glut of samey, mechanized Marvel and X- men movies obsessed with \u0027universing\u0027 a greater story, this one feels welcome and fresh.\n\nAnother obvious influence here are western films and this probably sheds some light on Wolverine\u0027s popularity. So many of the other X-men have awesome abilities to alter the fabric of reality; Wolverine is just a gruff who kicks and punches his way through. It seems there\u0027s always going to be a hankering for the simple, uncomplicated guy.\n\nSo what more obvious choice than to cast him in the light of cowboy? It works but you\u0027ll note it\u0027s not any cowboy. They could have used Red River as template, or The Searchers. They used Shane. The flawed guy who risks all to ensure there are \u0027no more guns in the valley\u0027 but must ride off again at the end because his kind has no place in the world of loving farmsteads.\n\nIt\u0027s always indicative of a broader sensibility when I see this type being used, the resignation that someone has no place in a changing world and is better off being swept away with the old, this seen as \u0027honorable\u0027 and heroic.\n\nBut from the little girl (and her friends\u0027) point-of- view we have what? A fictional Eden they only knew as stories in a book but their desire for it has inspired an actual one.",

      "reviewBody": "Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev\u0027s reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director\u0027s cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.\n\nFortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind\u0027s stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.\n\nThe ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia\u0027s greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky\u0027s imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.\n\nThe movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia\u0027s unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev\u0027s own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.\n\nIt is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don\u0027t know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.\n\nIt is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce\u0027s Finnegan\u0027s Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky\u0027s own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.\n\nTarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.",

      "reviewBody": "Carl Th. Dreyer\u0027s The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn\u0027t burned after its initial release, it would\u0027ve had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.\n\nAnd it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he\u0027s developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It\u0027s all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people\u0027s faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.\n\nThere have been many before me who have praised Falconetti\u0027s performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can\u0027t be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must\u0027ve felt watching Theron in the recent \u0027Monster\u0027. I didn\u0027t even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer\u0027s guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor\u0027s playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti\u0027s eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. \n\nFor me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That\u0027s the kind of effect that Dreyer\u0027s craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I\u0027m not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps.",

      "reviewBody": "Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I\u0027d be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.\n\nThe movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or \"Oh Captain, my Captain\", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.\n\nThere are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he\u0027s an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn\u0027t give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he\u0027s so embarrassed.\n\nPeter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie \"Master and Commander\" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.\n\nSome of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that \"he wanted to throw up at the end of the film\". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won\u0027t put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",

He lies, steals, skips school and runs away from home, and soon ends up in a juvenile delinquency centre.\n\nTruffaut\u0027s inspiration for this film came from his own depressed childhood, so he bases Antoine on himself, including in terms of appearance. Being a \u0027New Wave\u0027 (a cinematographic movement of the sixties, involving directors who believed Hollywood films were too lavish and unreal) director, Truffaut always used a real location for the film, including breathtaking shots of Truffaut\u0027s native Paris. He also made a cameo in the film in the style of Hitchcock.\n\nDelinquance is the key theme here. Antoine, who is a character who believes in liberty and freedom, and the way he is always locked up is repressive for him, and this provokes a constant need for him to be out.\n\nTrying to make a realistic and moving film was Truffaut\u0027s aim, which, by watching this film, I realised that he had done amazingly well. Also, by combining humour and drama too, we have the defining French film of the 20th century. A black and white film that is full of colour. Bien sur, François Truffaut.",

Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.\n\nIt would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.\n\nThe balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.\n\nThe characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.\n\nThe movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace",

      "reviewBody": "I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for £8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don\u0027t take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it\u0027s not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it\u0027s just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself \u0027it\u0027s only a movie and I am sure it won\u0027t take anything away from it\u0027 and thankfully it didn\u0027t. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don\u0027t usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn\u0027t really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother\u0027s girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn\u0027t like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.\n\nWhen Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it\u0027s not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn\u0027t seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it\u0027s best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.\n\nThe movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn\u0027t taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn\u0027t seem very convincing and doesn\u0027t really go anywhere. You think it\u0027s just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn\u0027t make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn\u0027t make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. \n\nAnother good solid foreign film that didn\u0027t hit all the marks but still very good.",

      "reviewBody": "At one point in \"Hotel Rwanda,\" our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.\n\nHow could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn\u0027t intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.\n\nA few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.\n\nThe Rwandan genocide - that\u0027s what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide  also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.\n\nTerry George\u0027s film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.\n\nWorking from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, \"Hotel Rwanda\" contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since \"Schindler\u0027s List\" (1993). But whereas Spielberg\u0027s masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don\u0027t mean that pejoratively - George\u0027s film seems more immediate. Maybe it\u0027s because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren\u0027t doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives \"Hotel Rwanda\" a sense of urgency.\n\nAs visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There\u0027s brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment\u0027s made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.\n\nMaking a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.\n\nCheadle carries the entire film. There isn\u0027t a false note in his performance. For years, he\u0027s turned in one superb performance after another. He\u0027s one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren\u0027t all that memorable. Here, he\u0027s in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul\u0027s frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.\n\nHe gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul\u0027s Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That\u0027s why the moment\u0027s shattering.\n\n\"Hotel Rwanda\" isn\u0027t flawless. George doesn\u0027t harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film\u0027s end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film\u0027s straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.\n\nI would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we\u0027re doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq\u0027s supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.\n\nI can only hope the success of \"Hotel Rwanda\" will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to.",

      "name": "If Miyazaki had made that film only, his legacy would have been the same...",
      "reviewBody": "The name of Nausicaä belongs to Greek mythology; she was the Princess who saved Ulysses from drowning. And the \"Valley of the Winds\" was loosely inspired from the tragedy of Minimata Bay and the way it maintained its ecosystem viable despite the pollution. \"Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds\" finds the perfect balance between the theme of nature always finding its way and the dramatic struggle of a heroine saving humanity from \"drowning\" in belligerent wickedness.\n\nI\u0027m mentioning Minimata but the tragedy of Fukushima could have inspired a similar intuition that technological advances could only lead to the downfall of humanity inasmuch as men continue to display the same carelessness and arrogance. In his \"Nausicaä\", Hayao Miyazaki doesn\u0027t warn us but rather confronts us to a plausible future, a future with a few survivors driven to the last corners of Earth where wind and water prevented a toxic jungle name Fukaï from spreading.\n\nThe film, all in visual splendor, displays the usual Sci-fi and Fantasy archetypes but they don\u0027t distract from the environmentalist and pacifist message. We accept them in the sense that the story is set one thousand years after the apocalypse and we expect technology to have produced jet-propelled gliders and flying vessels. But the film also has a Renaissance look à la \"Princess Mononoke\", it\u0027s not an artistic license, the privileged people of the Valley represent a wiser side of humanity that got back to the roots, acknowledging the eminence of nature, a renaissance indeed.\n\nThey live in an oasis-like area where the air is breathable, outside; they must wear a gas mask, accentuating the dystopian look even within a natural setting. The hostility of nature is symbolized by giant mutant insects and the Ohm, armored trilobite-like insects whose eyes turn to an ominous red whenever they feel threatened. But Miyazaki never lets us get the wrong idea about these Ohm, understand they\u0027re not the most life-threatening creatures out there.\n\nThere\u0027s a key scene right in the beginning where a little fox-like creature bites Nausicaä, she patiently keeps her finger until its frenzy fades out and then the animal licks her wound. This moment is pivotal because it highlights the real tragedy that caused men\u0027s downfall, not violent actions but immediate assumptions of violence causing bad reactions. Only Nausicaä is capable of showing mercy and empathy toward any living creature, she challenges all the common conceptions and even tries to understand the place she lives in, which is the epitome of wisdom.\n\nFrom the spores taken during regular expedition, she discovers in her laboratory that plants are capable of producing air, later in the film that some jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil and produce clean water. In other words, life always finds a way but humans can\u0027t see it. Nausicaä becomes the messianic character that will open the eyes of humanity, and as truth can be stranger than fiction, she\u0027s also a pivotal moment in Miyazaki\u0027s career, as the first film to have emerged from the fertile soil of his own imagination.\n\nNausicaä foreshadows all the elements that will define his work: the independent free-spirited heroine, the aerial settings and the environmental and anti-war messages, and more than that, the revolutionary notion that you don\u0027t need villains to make a story. Everyone is imperfect and fallible, even the most violent attacks are meant as defensive moves or precautions. The film contains a lot of action, lethal explosions and battles, people die by the sword, including Nausicaä\u0027s but Miyazaki couldn\u0027t have been more pacifists, every detail says in subtext that violence isn\u0027t the answer.\n\nIndeed, how can the cause of the trouble ever be the solution? Miyazaki, a master storyteller, delivers crucial information even in the most unnoticeable moments, even the opening credits show through Roman mosaic and medieval tapestry the fate of the modern world. Seven giants launching immense fire blasts (metaphor for nuclear power?) into modern buildings, it\u0027s just as if Hiroshima was depicted like the Pompeii eruption. But what is the tragedy exactly, that history taught men a lesson or that men didn\u0027t learn it? \n\nNausicaä is set at a time that looks like a second chance but people are still fighting for good or bad reasons, from a sword master and father-figure named Lord Yupa, a young Pejite interceptor who respects Nausicaä\u0027s actions and the Tolmekian queen who (like Lady Eboshi from \"Mononoke\") is perhaps the tumultuous counterpart to Nausicaä, mutilated by the creatures, she believes in violence as the language of the force, illustrating its dangerously communicative effect, the never-ending spiral that killed the world or that might lead to a third worldwide conflict.\n\nAnd in the midst of nihilistic violence and desolation, Nausicca emerges as a beautifully inspirational heroine. There\u0027s a hypnotic flashback (with a so-catchy playful tone) where Nausicaä\u0027s father kills a baby Ohm, on the basis that human and insects can\u0027t live together. The whole conviction of Nausicaä is that every creature has its place on Earth; it\u0027s not just about empathy but the unshakable faith on Nature\u0027s equilibrium. It is very significant that the most beautiful images from the film, all in golden yellow, are provided by the Ohm\u0027s tentacles, weren\u0027t they supposed to be the ugly monsters? \n\nYet, at the time of its release, the film was badly edited for foreign audiences and lost into translation to become some Manga adventure in the air, and the Ohm were indeed hostile creatures. It\u0027s just as if Miyazaki was ahead of his time and it would take one decade and half before people would come back to their senses and realize that this isn\u0027t \"Flash Gordon\". Nausicaä is about conviction and goodness, pacifism and environmentalism deprived from any political innuendo.\n\nMiyazaki drew the original Manga so the film could be made, showcasing as much confidence as his heroine. In a way, Miyazaki was the Nausicaä of animation, a man with a vision, spirit and guts.",

I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.\n\nKeaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. \n\nJust brilliant.",

I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. \n\nThis movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.\n\nThematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.\n\nThe story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.\n\nThe music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.\n\nIt isn\u0027t a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.",

Hitchcock\u0027s style and eye for detail combine very well with a story (from a novel that is extremely good in its own right) filled with psychological fear and settings that are interesting and suggestive.\n\nMost of the time the story itself moves fairly slowly, allowing the focus to be on the characters, but there are also a couple of very good plot twists, which can be very surprising if you\u0027ve not seen the movie or read the novel. So if you happen not to know the story, it\u0027s a good idea to see the film before reading a lot of comments about it. Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and George Sanders are all perfectly cast and do a wonderful job bringing their characters to life, and making you feel a part of the story.\n\n\"Rebecca\" should be satisfying not only to any Hitchcock fan, but to anyone who likes classic movies. Whether you like romance, suspense, or drama, they\u0027re all here, and put together by a director and cast that are masters of their art.",

      "reviewBody": "It\u0027s hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle\u0027s and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone\u0027s vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.\n\nRocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn\u0027t like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn\u0027t so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It\u0027s about a guy, much like you or me, who\u0027s down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He\u0027s pushing 30, single and broke. I\u0027m sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason. \n\nIt\u0027s hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he\u0027s talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It\u0027s a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone\u0027s face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn\u0027t in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it\u0027s empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he\u0027s wasting his life. It\u0027s more than beautiful or real.\n\nIt\u0027s safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God\u0027s help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I\u0027d want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn\u0027t care. Because, \"I\u0027m at least half a bum.\"",

      "reviewBody": "Monsters, Inc.\n\nWe were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us \"Toy Story\" 1 \u0026 2, plays on both adults\u0027 memories and children\u0027s dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.\n\nJohn Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as \"Sulley\" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children\u0027s screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children\u0027s rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...\n\n\"Monsters, Inc.\" does for monsters what \"Toy Story\" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my \"Toy Story\" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience\u0027s INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of \"Toy Story\" and \"Monsters, Inc.,\" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for \"Toy Story 3\") and gives them the bare minimum.\n\nBut that is straying off the subject. \"Monsters, Inc.\" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn\u0027t enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with \"Toy Story\" 1 \u0026 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50\u0027s-70\u0027s. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.\n\nNot only has Pixar brought back the \"Family Film\" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar\u0027s animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.\n\n5/5 stars",

      "reviewBody": "Moviemakers when filming French based films have traditionally tended to sentimentalise the people\u0027 through the celebration of les petits gens, the little people of Pagnol and Clair as well as more recently the fantastical Parisian wonderland environments of Amelie and Moulin Rouge. With La Haine, young director Mathieu Kassovitz took the flipside of this and gave an illustration of the awfulness of life in the depressed blue-collar areas of Paris\n\nLa Haine (Hate\u0027) begins after a night of rioting on a dismal housing estate on the northern outskirts of Paris and focuses on 24 hours in the lives of three close friends aged around 20. They are Vince (Vincent Cassel), an explosive working-class Jew, Hubert (Hubert Kounde), a handsome, soft-spoken black, and Said (Said Taghmaoui), a mercurial streetwise Arab. With little hopes or prospect of regular employment due to where they come from, the trio drift aimlessly, engaging in petty theft, and seething with aggressive resentment against an uncaring world. L\u0027Avenir c\u0027est nous (We Are the Future) is the ironic slogan on the estate\u0027s playground, but this is a film about people who believe they have no future.\n\nThe quality of the performances from the 3 main actors, their conviction, the way they interact with one another and the vigour and fluency of Kassovitz\u0027s script and direction make this a very special movie indeed. Its full of action, detail, unexpected incidents and quirky humour. For instance, the boys have a bizarre encounter in a public lavatory in central Paris with a diminutive survivor of the Gulag that is as puzzling to them as it is to us. Does the story the Gulag survivor tells them have a deeper meaning than on the surface? Of course it does, and importantly this film makes you think as to what the metaphor means. Throughout violence is always on the point of erupting. There are constant confrontations with a brutal, racist police force, and Vince has a 44 Magnum revolver that a plainclothes cop lost during the riots, which we know will eventually be used on someone. However none of this ever descends into mere gratuitous violence like so many Hollywood films\n\nLa Haine presents a state of affairs of the alienation faced by many young people in the projects\u0027 in France, and all over the world. It doesn\u0027t offer any solutions, though the point is forcibly made that in France, as elsewhere, parts of the police force are part of the problem rather than the solution. Of course, much of what we are shown is familiar to us from British and American films .\n\nThe strength of the film is that it neither glamorises nor patronises its characters. They hate their life because it\u0027s boring, and they despise the society that\u0027s created it for them, together with parks, football fields and a few mod cons with which to comfort them. In particular, they hate the police, who hate them right back. The film\u0027s other major achievement is to show in a tangible and very expressive way how a cycle of distrust and anger is created on both sides of this awful divide, so that there is very little anyone can do about it. In other words violence and hate breeds more violence and hate.\n\nA criticism that could be levelled is that in the US / UK versions the sub-titles don\u0027t help, pushing what is very authentic dialogue into something more like cliché, as well as pointless miss-translations that occur. However this is just a minor thing, and does not and should not reflect at all on the film itself.\n\nThis certainly is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Its one of those rare films that you will think about for the days and weeks after  not solely about the film itself, but on wider issues such as society, poverty and racism.",

      "reviewBody": "It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic, and on so many `must-see\u0027 lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another. It wasn\u0027t until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn\u0027t.\n\nThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator. She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation. Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits. The film quickly turns into an `on the road\u0027 flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story. Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.\n\nI\u0027m a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy. Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles. Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.\n\n Whatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner. It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.\n\n--Shelly",

      "reviewBody": "Two people living in the same flat complex find their partners are having an affair with each other. As they try and piece together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolution\n\nBuilding on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions, yearning and unrequited love. \n\nPossibly, In the Mood for Love is not to everyone\u0027s taste. It wanders in rather lazily at 98mins: not particularly long for a film, but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. Most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays, where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to work out how the affair started. I say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is \"in-role\" and what is genuine. \n\nIf all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience, that\u0027s because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong\u0027s finest, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with some excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan.\n\nIt is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience to a sensory, and sensual, overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his lush, over-ripe style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen on Springtime in a Small Town) was cinematographic genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the Athena-poster cheesiness of his work on Hero. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. \n\nAll in all a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders\u0027 Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful, old fashioned story about love lost and regained. \n\nAnd watch out for Tony Leung\u0027s hotel room 2046, which presaged Wong\u0027s recent film of the same name.",

His Chemistry with the character \u0027Durga\u0027 was awesome. \n\n\u0027sardar khan\u0027s interaction with ramadhir singh in the movie is very interesting. \n\nThe movie was brilliant in first half. The only place where the movie could improve is that there are so many characters that a normal audience will be confused and may just lose the plot. One needs to watch the movie carefully.\n\n9/10 to the movie made about my locality. Wasseypur Zindabad!",

It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked \u0027Before Sunrise\u0027 as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says \"nothing that is complete breathes\", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.\n\nThe dialogue is amazing, the acting is spot-on; this is a great film. In some ways it felt more like reading a great novel than watching a movie, in that I really felt like I knew the characters and was sad the movie had to end. Kind of like saying goodbye to an old friend. If you are an action movie kind of person, skip this flick because it will bore you to tears. If, on the other hand, you like good dialogue, well formed characters, and aren\u0027t quite jaded enough to have given up completely on the idea of true love, don\u0027t miss this film.",

Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm. Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them. \"The Princess Bride\" is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly. It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen. The only other movie of this type that I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye\u0027s \"The Court Jester,\" another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highly recommend.",

      "reviewBody": "\"Ace In the Hole,\" which used to turn up on local TV as \"The Big carnival,\" was far head of its time. It wasn\u0027t very successful and its cynicism shocked people.\n\nAlong comes Andy Warhol almost two decades later with his notion of \"fifteen minutes of fame\" and everyone buys that concept. It\u0027s not quite the same as the concept of this. Nor is that of the very popular \"Network,\" which came even later. But the premise here is that reporter Kirk Douglas will literally jeopardize a man\u0027s life in order to get a series of big newspaper stories. And does anyone today doubt that such things happen? Wilder was often cynical, though here it is to the most meaningful end. \"the Fortune Cookie\" and \"Kiss Me, Stupid\" are cynical also and they are both fun but this one makes a very trenchant point and they do not.\n\nThe acting is superb. Kirk Douglas gave many brilliant performances. This is one of them. The trailer included in the DVD I just saw crows that with this Jan Sterling will be immediately elevated to the top rank of female stars. That never happened but she is excellent here, as generally elsewhere.\n\nThe interviews of Wilder by Cameron Crowe tell a funny story about the genesis of one of her lines. I\u0027d better not quote it; so get that book. It\u0027s very entertaining, informative, and touching.\n\nWilder was one of \u003dthis country\u0027s great directors. This will probably never be one of his most popular movies but I\u0027d certainly rank it as one of his best.",

We know by now that the plight of the \"colored\" in the South wasn\u0027t that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild margins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn\u0027t forget documentaries of the period or \"The Long Walk Home\" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in \"The Help\" too and she\u0027s very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She\u0027s better here than she\u0027s ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that\u0027s were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.",

      "reviewBody": "I first heard of \"The Red Shoes\" when I read the liner notes to an album by the jazz/fusion group Weather Report, called \"Tale Spinnin\u0027\". Therein it said that saxophonist Wayne Shorter had seen the film a few dozen times. Intrigued, I watched it when I noticed it in the TV listings. What a discovery!\n\nWith its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina, a composer, and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both, the story may have elements of a soap opera, but it\u0027s a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter, I\u0027m sure, is the film\u0027s depiction of the artists\u0027 creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere, but I haven\u0027t seen it. Besides that, it\u0027s beautifully directed, beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning, and I\u0027m not just using that word as a cliche.\n\nAnton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov, leader of the ballet troupe. There are many real-life artists from the ballet world in the film, including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.\n\nDon\u0027t be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film; it\u0027s high quality AND accessible. Anyone who enjoys art (especially ballet), romance or just plain good moviemaking owes it to themselves to see it.",

This film was probably an early warning to us all of how life can easily overwhelm without us realising it. It is also virtually unique in the successful portrayal of a man who is deeply lost in his innermost thoughts that the outside world becomes almost a minutiae. Mr Stanton encapsulates this mood perfectly and this is probably his best performance ever. The most moving scene (and there are many) might be when he reviews some old cine film of his life (a normal happy love story which surely could not have gone wrong so badly)before he walked away from it all. I can\u0027t help but think this is a real life epistle which could be a marker for how life has overtaken the human race in the last 20 years.",

The dancing and singing made my heart pound and my heart overwhelmed by the matchless beauty and I was imagining myself following along with Gauri. I love this story and I could watch it daily and never tire of the beauty it holds. I have always loved indian people and the culture which they live, I am American and have never visited India,soon I will visit in person and dreams of going there will no longer tug at me . I hope to one day perform the dances as well as those in the movie. I really loved that in the movie the characters were faced with such hardship but somehow they were of cheer and sang together and lifted one anothers spirits.I love this movie some may tire of its length but I wish it would continue forever.

Great involving director, great story, told so nicely, very very interesting, superb editing and wonderful role played by the total cast. Ajay Devgn after long time in so balanced underacting(Totally not Singham type);but a most responsible struggling hard-worker family man, who is ready to anything for his family. Shreya Saran; who is most glamorous heroine from South( remember Shivaji- the boss-Rajnikanth-Shankar?) has done role of typical Indian housewife.Tanu is role of brutal and tough cop and her husband; who is a big businessman-role played by total underacting and balanced work by our marvelous actor RajatKapoor- all steal the show. We have shortage of such spine chilling suspense crime thrillers in Bollywood as last was \u0027Wednesday\u0027. In Hollywood Alfred Hichckok has given so many spine-chilling thrillers and I do recollect Edward Fox\u0027s \u0027The day of the jackal\u0027 and Bruce Willis+Rachard Gere in \u0027Jackal .\u0027The executive decision\u0027- was also such spine chilling thriller and we do recollect \u0027Taken-1,2,3,\u0027 and \u0027Unknown etc. The year 2015 has been so luck for the cinema viewers that we have received so marvelous and wonderful movies throughout the year and this is one of them. A great family drama cum thriller cum suspense movie cum crime movie, filled the stuff of police brutality, innocent child acting, burning problems faced regularly by the teenager daughter and their parents-we are reading of news papers and seeing in all medias-mms scandal, blackmailing, etc. This movie tackles so many our social problems in so nice way to digest easily and provoke the thoughts and succeeds to win the sympathy of the audience.10 star or more. A must watch family drama cum thriller cum spine-chilling suspense movie. Very brilliant movie. For me its better than The Shawshank Redemption",

      "reviewBody": "\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America. It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.\n\nButch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law. The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do. The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them. There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.\n\nThe story isn\u0027t about the plot, however. It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking. The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film. Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.\n\nSee this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.\n\n**** out of ****",

      "reviewBody": "I was probably around 8, when I first saw Akira. It was my step dad who asked me if I was interested in watching this Japanese cartoon. I expected something like, my favorite children movies like The Lion King or The Land before Time.\n\nAkira however, was something else. At the time I was to young to understand English, since it was a second language for me. But I remember what kind of an affect it had on me. It was brutal, it was hard, it was edgy. The drums and Neo Tokyo lights flew through my little body as butter, as I witnessed death, gore and sadistic killings. Something my pure and innocent eyes had never seen before. And yet I was strangely excited. I was never tough as a kid. I was a afraid of the dark and often had nightmares about all kinds of things. But Akira, despite it\u0027s mature nature, just had me in awe. When I finally re-saw it many years later, when I was an old teenager, I was still in awe.\n\nAkira is simply a wonderful and entertaining sci-fi movie. It was what introduced me to anime, and innovation in a hole new way. If you want to start watching anime or see, what all the fuss is about, then Akira is a good place to start. Even though it\u0027s over 17 years old today, it is still a fantastic and visually stunning animation. Even if you don\u0027t appreciate animation you owe it to yourself, to check it out. It has spectacular action, motorcycle-chase-sequences, mad scientists and tons of blood and shooting.\n\n8/10",

Whoever wrote this story had given it much thought on the basic idea as it was thought provoking and tries to shatter the root of evil in our religious society. \n\nBut the upper layers of the story were like any other Indian movie, with same emotional drama in awkward places, a love story, an evil guy who gets ridiculed, etc. Thus the movie couldn\u0027t get too deep. It couldn\u0027t deliver to its full potential, but at any moment in the story I didn\u0027t feel bored. Songs are right on spot and creates a good mood. \n\nThe movie also makes you realize how colorful, beautiful yet complex Indian society is.

      "reviewBody": "Winner of the prestigious Palme d\u0027Or at 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Winter Sleep arrives with high expectations but succeeds amazingly well in living up to its new-found honour for this Turkish drama is simply one of the most engrossing, mesmerizing \u0026 satisfying narratives to surface on the silver screen in the past year, and is definitely one of the best films of 2014.\n\nSet in Anatolia, the story of Winter Sleep concerns Aydın; the wealthy owner of a mountaintop hotel who was once an actor but has since fallen into the hibernation mode over the years. The plot covers the chaos his self-involved persona brings to his small kingdom as the animosity of his loved ones \u0026 the poor people under his reign begins surfacing once the winter approaches.\n\nDirected by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the film takes a very methodical, patient \u0026 firm approach with its narrative which does a stellar job in slowly unraveling the inner details of the various characters inhabiting this story. The entire story is an amalgamation of one conversation after another but it\u0027s how each discussion begins \u0026 ends plus seamlessly switches from one to another that makes it such an immersive experience.\n\nThe locations are wonderfully chosen, set pieces are finely detailed, the hotel itself creates a calm but secluded ambiance which becomes all the more suffocating on the advent of winter. Camera-work is mostly still yet effective plus the landscapes are beautifully photographed, its 196 minutes of runtime never really bothers for the most part, thanks to its breezy storytelling \u0026 the score makes its presence felt just when it\u0027s required.\n\nComing to the performances, every single actor here chips in strongly in their given roles \u0026 leave nothing to complain about. Haluk Bilginer delivers a magnificent performance as Aydın, and is brilliantly supported by Demet Akbağ \u0026 Melisa Sözen who play his sister \u0026 wife, respectively. The rest of the cast also shines since each character is deftly scripted \u0026 gradually developed which differentiates them from caricatures.\n\nOn an overall scale, Winter Sleep is an intensely gripping, masterfully told \u0026 exquisitely layered study of a self-righteous character that also takes an interesting look at failing relationships, old age regrets, class divides, and the morals of right \u0026 wrong. And despite its challenging runtime, dialogue-driven plot \u0026 slow-burn narration, it manages to be a truly immersive \u0026 absorbing cinema that\u0027s worthy of your time \u0026 money. Highly recommended.",

      "name": "Probably The Best Anime Film Of 2017",
      "reviewBody": "When it comes to anime, I don\u0027t find myself watching nearly enough in order to form a list of favourites, but even if I had watched everything under the moon, I still believe A Silent Voice would make the list. This is a spectacular film from start to finish. Keep in mind, this can be a very tough film to sit through for multiple reasons, and that is exactly what I\u0027m going to dive into throughout this review, because I feel that a few precautions should be taken when going in. Here is why A Silent Voice deserves to be seen by everyone, even though it won\u0027t please everyone.\n\nAt its core, this film is about a new student that comes into a school, who just so happens to be hearing impaired. Ishida, the school bully, taunts her to the point of tears, for audiences as well. Without ruining the impact of certain scenes, I\u0027ll just say that his actions were quite Risqué. I found myself absolutely hating his character, which was very frustrating, due to the fact that the film asks you to sympathize with him on multiple occasions. After growing up and leaving his harsh ways in the past, these two characters reconnect, forming a highly unlikely bond. A Silent Voice asks for your acceptance almost too often, but trust me, if you\u0027re in the forgiving mood, this film turns out to be extremely powerful. So that\u0027s the warning I must give you, that if you\u0027re not ready to be forgiving of a terrible actions, I\u0027d wait until you\u0027re in the right mood to watch this movie.\n\nThroughout Ishida\u0027s transformation from a bully to a kind-hearted human being, it wasn\u0027t just the dialogue that impacted me, but the visuals surrounding him. Every time he would pass by other people that knew him, they had X\u0027s on their face. When this aspect comes into play a little later in the movie, I\u0027d be lying if I said it didn\u0027t move me. From beginning to hate the film for displaying a very unlikable character, this story really does a great job at winning you over, especially through it\u0027s silent, visual storytelling in the background, foreground, and even anytime that it makes it blatantly obvious.\n\nWhen a movie makes you wait for it to be really good, it can be a pretty frustrating experience, but I see something different when reflecting on this film. It\u0027s all about redemption and how forgiveness is everything when you truly want to become a better person that what you were in the past. Evil is all throughout everyone, but you\u0027re not supposed to act on it. This is one of the message that I feel the movie tries to convey and I believe it\u0027s a wonderful lesson to everyone. The themes presented throughout this film are taken very seriously, so I don\u0027t think it will appeal to a younger audience, but I think older teenagers will be the perfect demographic here, for the lesson it\u0027s giving.\n\nIn the end, A Silent Voice is a film that had me hating throughout the first act, realizing I was wrong throughout the second act, and on the verge of tears throughout the third act, due to how well this movie does a complete 180. With a powerful story, a final sequences that will have many in tears, and an overall film that is worthy of awards, I can\u0027t recommend this enough. That being said, I can\u0027t get myself to give this movie a perfect score, due to the fact that I think it took a little too long to win me over. I found myself disliking the movie throughout the majority of it, until my eventual realization, which is my one warning, so I feel I won\u0027t be alone on that. A Silent Voice is one of the best movies I\u0027ve seen so far this year.",
